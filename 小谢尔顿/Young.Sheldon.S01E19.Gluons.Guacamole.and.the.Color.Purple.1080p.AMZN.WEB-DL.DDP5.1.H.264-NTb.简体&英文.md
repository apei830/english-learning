| 不是吧  | Oh, no. |
| 现在我们可以讨论  | So, now we can discuss |
| 微扰量子色动力学修正对半径矢量轴是什么  | what the perturbative QCD corrections to R-bar look like. |
| 你还可以把它写成  | So, you can also write it as "R" |
| 用"R"除以半径长度"R"  | divided by the length of "R." |
| 就会得出单位长度...  | That would be a vector |
| 的矢量  | of unit length... |
| 与半径"R"...  | ...parallel... |
| 平行  | to "R." |
| 抱歉  我刚说到哪了  | I'm sorry, where was I? |
| 用"R"除以半径长度"R"  | "R" Divided by the length of "R." |
| 那会是单位长度的矢量  与半径"R"平行  | That would be a vector of unit length parallel to "R." |
| 对  谢谢你  | Oh, yes. Thank you. |
| 所以如果用"R"除以半径长度"R"  | So, if you divide "R" by the length of "R," |
| 就会得出单位长度...  | that would be a vector... |
| 的矢量  与...  | of unit length parallel... |
| 平行...  | to... |
| 我想你该走了  | I think you need to leave. |
| 那么  | So... |
| 当我们用"R"除以半径长度"R"  | when we divide "R" By the length of "R," |
| 就会得出单位长度的矢量  | that would be a vector of unit length |
| 与半径"R"平行  | parallel to "R." |
| 长官  坏消息  | Sir, bad news. |
| 别告诉我  又出现了一个  | Don't tell me. There's another problem |
| 我们不够聪明来解决的问题  | we're not smart enough to solve? |
| 是人造卫星  液氦快汽化了  | It's the satellite-- the liquid helium is boiling off. |
| 怎么会发生这种事  | Well, why the heck would that happen? |
| 我来告诉你  | I'll tell you why. |
| 太阳一定是被太阳能板反射  | The sun must be glinting off the solar panel |
| 照到杜瓦瓶了  | and hitting the dewar. |
| 你为什么不知道这点  | Why didn't you know that? |
| 我就是个废物  长官  | I'm a disappointment, sir. |
| 我们必须计算出所有  | We need to calculate all the Euler angles |
| 会导致太阳照到液氦的欧拉角  | that would cause the sun to hit the liquid helium. |
| 你能及时算出来吗  | Can you do it in time? |
| 跟我的新朋友约翰·斯特吉斯一起  我就可以  | I can with my new friend, Dr. John Sturgis. |
| 大家好  | Hello. |
| 你好  | Hi. |
| 他准备跟我姥姥结婚  | He's gonna marry my meemaw. |
| 我给她买了一辆自行车  | I bought her a bicycle. |
| 是紫色的自行车  | A purple bicycle. |
| 紫色  听起来是爱的颜色  | Purple? Sounds like love to me. |
| 库珀先生  | Mr. Cooper?! |
| 你有专心听吗  | Are you paying attention? |
| 这些我已经会了  | I already know this. |
| 你已经会了吗  | You know this? |
| 但他们不会  所以请继续吧  | But they don't, so by all means, continue. |
