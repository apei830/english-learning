| 小姑娘  这事你别闹  | This isn't a joke, young lady. |
| 没错  你弟弟是很聪明  | Yes, your brother may be smart, |
| 但他在这世上还没有一个朋友  | but he doesn't have a friend in the world. |
| 对不起  但我真的很担心他  | And I am sorry, but I am very worried about him. |
| 不错啊  你害妈妈快急疯了  | Nice going. You're making Mom a nervous wreck. |

| 这是在干嘛  | What's going on? |
| 我在练习运用这本书里教的原则  | Well, I'm practicing the principles in this book. |
| -为什么  -我知道妈妈很担心  | - Why? - Well, I know Mom is concerned |
| 我身边没有朋友  | that I don't have any friends, |
| 所以我下决心要解决这个问题  | so I'm determined to remedy the situation. |
| 乔治  | George. |
| 那挺好  | Well, good for you. |
| 我这么喊你名字  你有感到受称赞吗  乔治  | Do you feel complimented when I say your name, George? |
| 书上说你会有这感受  乔治  | The book says you should. George. |
| 大概吧  | I suppose. |
| 不过你有点用力过猛  | Kind of overdoing it a little. |
| -谢尔顿  -谢谢你的批评  | - Sheldon. - Well, thank you for your criticism. |
| 书里也说  我应该对你任何的进步做出赞赏  | It also says I should praise any improvements that you've made. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 回头再聊吧  | I'll get back to you. |
| 乔治  | George. |
| 紧接在这大获成功的测试后  | On the heels of that successful beta test, |

| 你会感兴趣的交谈  | about something that interests you. |
| 你是"特殊教育"班的孩子吗  | Oh, are you one of those special ed kids? |
| 我妈说我很特殊  | My mom says I'm special. |

| 你中间数漏了11个数  | You missed 11 numbers. |
| 我不需要数学那么好  人家有一头秀发  | I don't need to be good at math. I have beautiful hair. |
| 这是我这辈子听过最悲催的话  | That's the saddest thing I've ever heard. |
| 你不是已经读完那本书了吗  | Didn't you already read that book? |
| 我在重读  | I'm reading it again. |
| 为什么  | How come? |
| 我肯定有哪里读漏了  | I clearly missed something. |
| 我找不到一个愿意跟我当朋友的人  | I couldn't find one person who wanted to be my friend. |
| 你看过里面的借书卡了吗  | Did you look at the card inside? |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 卡上只有其他借过这本书的人的名字  | That's just other people who checked out the book. |
| 这是其他像你一样找不到朋友的废柴名单  | It's a list of losers like you who can't find a friend. |
| 那又如何  | So? |
| 他们求友心切  而你手握名单  | So they're desperate, and you have their names. |
| 太聪明了  | That's brilliant. |
| 那你怎么就数不好数呢  | Now, how is it that you can't count? |
| 你爸爸跟我说你最近新读了本书  | So your father tells me you've been reading a new book? |
| 是啊  是教你怎么交朋友  | I am. It's about how to make friends. |
| 你对这件事有兴趣吗  | Is that something you're interested in? |
| 没什么兴趣  但米希跟我说  | Not really, but Missy told me |
| 我没有朋友你很难过  | it makes you sad that I don't have any. |
| 我得去把这姑娘的嘴缝起来  | I got to sew that girl's mouth shut. |
| 那发展如何  | So how's it going? |
| 书里教的原则对我根本不管用  | Well, the principles in the book didn't work for me at all. |
| 不过老爸挺喜欢被人反复叫乔治  | Although Dad does like being called George over and over again, |
| 你可以试试这招  | so you might give that a try. |
| 宝贝  你不需要因为我而给自己添麻烦  | Baby, you don't have to go to any trouble for me. |
| 但我喜欢为你付出  | But I like doing things for you. |
| 你是个好人  | You're a nice lady. |
| -但如果那书没用...  -的确没用  | - But if the book's not working... - It isn't. |
| 但我意识到如果我去找  | But I realized if I find the other people |
| 其他借过这书的人  因为他们也想结交朋友  | who checked out the book, they'd be looking for friends, too. |
| 这招真聪明  | That's really smart. |
| -是米希想出来的  -不是吧  | - Missy thought of it. - You're kidding. |
| 我当时也像你一样惊讶  | I'm as surprised as you are. |
| 打扰一下  英格拉姆女士  | Excuse me, Ms. Ingram? |
| 谢尔顿  现在是下课时间  | Sheldon, it's recess. |
| 去外面玩  体验一下外面  | Go outside, see what it's like. |
| 你是伊芙琳·英格拉姆吗  | Are you by any chance Evelyn Ingram? |
| 是的  | Yes. |
| 借出过这本书的伊芙琳·英格拉姆吗  | The same Evelyn Ingram who checked out this book? |
| 这关你什么事呢  | And why is that your business? |
| 我只是在想你当时想要结交朋友  | I just assumed you were looking to make a friend. |
| 这是很久以前了  | Well, that was a long time ago. |
| 我当时刚从一段惨痛的感情抽身  | I had just gotten out of a very difficult relationship. |
| -跟朋友吗  -朋友  | - With a friend? - Friend. |
| 我给那男人奉献了我三年的人生时光  | Ha! I gave that man three years of my life |
| 还有我的童真  | and my innocence. |
| 我不懂那是什么意思  | I don't know what that means. |
| 男人都是骗人的狗东西  只对一件事感兴趣  | It means men are lying dogs only interested in one thing. |
| 字典上不是这么解释的  | Well, that's not the dictionary definition. |
| 开始都是一样的  | Always starts the same. |
| 茫茫人海中的一次对视  不经意地手搭肩上  | A quick glance across the room, a casual hand on the shoulder, |
| 在连锁便利店里吃午饭  | lunch at Stuckey's. |
| 一开始都是很浪漫  花前月下    | Oh, yeah, it's all romance and flowers in the beginning... |
| 这名单被证明是一把双刃剑  | The list proved to be a double-edged sword. |
| 原来1936年写的励志书  | It turns out self-help books written in 1936 |
| 是专门写成给成年人看的  | were only of interest to adults. |
| 我就说"老娘是因为在乎才来  | You're like, "I'm here because I care. |
| 还有  你的电话也是能打出去的好吗"  | And by the way, your phone could make calls, too." |
| 然后他就试着把整件事  | Then tries to turn this whole thing around |
| 转移成是你太粘人  | like it's all about you being needy, |
| 你当然会说"废话  我当然有需求  | and you're like, "Yes, I have needs! |
| 人就是有需求才会是人啊"  | That's what makes me human!" |
| 感情上有问题的成人  | Emotionally troubled adults. |
| 孩子  出去外面玩吧  | Child, go outside. |
| 是的  那是我的签名  你问这个干嘛  | Yes, that's my signature. Why do you ask? |
| 我在寻找想交朋友的人  | I'm seeking people who want to make friends. |
| 我没兴趣交朋友  | I wasn't interested in friends. |
| 我借那本书是为了帮助自己爬到校长位置  | I took out that book to help me become school principal. |
| -成功了吗  -我们现在是在校长办公室说话吗  | - Did it work? - Are we sitting in the principal's office? |
| -不是  -你知道为什么吗  | - No. - And you know why? |
| 因为维多利亚·马克艾罗伊不是男人  | Because Victoria MacElroy is not a man! |
| 我确认一下  你没兴趣交朋友  | So to be clear, you're not interested in making friends? |
| 我唯一有兴趣的就是命够长  | What I'm interested in is in living long enough |
| 长到可以看到女人不再被当二等公民对待  | to see women no longer treated like second-class citizens. |
| 如果你想长命百岁  | Well if your goal is a long life, |
| 那你吃这个热辣芝士堡只能帮倒忙  | that chili cheeseburger is a step in the wrong direction. |
| 食物是老娘唯一的慰藉了  | Food is all I have. |
| 如同我说的  | Like I said, |
| 感情上有问题的成人  | emotionally troubled adults. |
| 你要看着我吃饭吗  | You gonna watch me eat? |
| 出去  | Get out of here. |
| 所有人都告诉我  | Everybody told me, |
| "休伯特  别跟同事约会"  | "Hubert, don't date someone from work." |
| 我听话了吗  没有  | But did I listen? No. |
| 让我告诉你一件事  | Let me tell you something. |
| 她喜欢说我偷走她童真对吗  | She likes to say I stole her innocence? |
| 那我的童真呢  | Well, what about my innocence? |
| 分手之后我再也不是从前那个我了  | I was never the same after we broke up. |
| 两年后  | Two years later, |
| 吉文斯先生变成了校长  | Mr. Givens became the high school principal, |
| 或许马克艾罗伊女士变成重度胖子也与此有关  | which might be why Ms. MacElroy became morbidly obese. |
| 我有头脑  又讨人喜欢  而且我不想炫耀  | I had the brains, I had the charm, and I don't like to brag, |
| 但我当年也算得上小鲜肉一枚  | but I was pretty easy on the eyes back then. |
| 那娘们简直赚大发了好吗  | That woman got herself one heck of a package. |
| 但某些人就是不想被满足  | But some people don't want to be satisfied. |
| 这书有用吗  | Is that any good? |
| 很遗憾并没有  | I'm afraid not. |
| 我没交到一个朋友  | I failed to make a single friend. |
| 真可惜  我交朋友也四处碰壁  | That sucks. I have a tough time making friends, too. |
| 最糟糕的部分是  我妈妈很在意这件事  | The worst part is, it was important to my mom. |
| 我父母也总是给我压力让我去交朋友  | My parents pressure me about making friends all the time. |
| 所以你很能理解我的遭遇  | So you understand what I'm going through. |
| 我读过那本书  很赞  | Oh, I read that book. It's excellent. |
| 罗伯特·戈达德  美国教授  物理学家和发明家    | 液体火箭的发明者 |
| 你也对火箭学有兴趣吗  | Are you into rocketry? |
| 我是从气压式喷水火箭开始玩  | I started with water propulsion, |
| 后来开始玩固体燃料火箭  | worked my way up to solid fuel, |
| 把我家车库烧了之后  我又回去玩喷水火箭了  | then went back to water after I set our garage on fire. |
| -厉害  -我也尝试过去弄铀  | - Nice. - I also tried to get some uranium |
| 来做一个原子能引擎  但那东西太难弄到手  | and build an atomic engine, but that stuff's hard to find. |
| 这样也好  | Probably for the best. |
| 祝你找朋友的道路能一切顺遂  | Well, good luck on your quest to find a friend. |
| 你也是  | You, too. |
| 如果你还没找到朋友  我有个好消息  | If you haven't found one yet, I have good news. |
| 妈  你对百忧解这种药了解吗  | Mom, what do you know about the drug Prozac? |
| 了解不多  | Not much. |
| 好像能让忧郁的人们开心点  怎么了  | Supposed to make people happier. Why? |
| 我只是在想这药或许能帮助我一些老师  | I was just thinking some of my teachers might benefit from it. |
| 说到这个  | Speaking of which, |
| 有一件你会高兴的事  我今天交到朋友了  | you'll be happy to know I made a friend today. |
| 那太好啦  | Well, that's nice. |
| 但就像我说过的  交朋友不是为了我  | But, as I said, this isn't for me. |
| 是为了你自己  | It's for you. |
| 他交到朋友啦  | He made a friend! |
| 他成功了  | He did it! |
| 我们的儿子交到朋友了  | Our little boy has got a friend. |
| -谁啊  -无所谓啦  | - Who is it? - Who cares? |
| 反正是个人类  是个有血有肉的人  | It's a human being. It's a warm body. |
| 妈  | Mom? |
| 怎么啦  亲爱的  | Yes, honey? |
| 我能进来吗  当然  | Can I come in? Of course. |
| 冷静  | Be cool. |
| 怎么啦  小宝贝  | What's up, sweetie? |
| 我想知道我什么时候能继续我火箭学的爱好  | I was wondering when I could continue my rocketry hobby. |
| 谢尔顿  我们聊过这个了  | Uh, Sheldon, we've been through this. |
| 火箭随便造  但不许发射  | You can build them. You just can't launch them. |
| 但发射才是好玩的那部分啊  | But launching them is the fun part. |
| 你去跟那被火烧死的松鼠一家解释去  | Tell that to the family of squirrels who died in the fire. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 我只是想可以跟新朋友一起做这个  | It was just something I was hoping to do with my new friend. |
| 等等  | Hang on. |
| 行吧  | Uh, yes. |
| 做吧  | It's fine. |
| 解除禁令  | Ban is lifted. |
| -玛丽  -是为了跟他朋友玩嘛  | - Mary... - It's for his friend. |
| 他有朋友了  | He's got a friend. |
| 而且当时被烧死的也可能是老鼠啊  | Besides, those could have been rats. |
| 被烧得都不成鼠形了  谁知道呢  | Their bodies were so badly burned. |
| 我还以为我们要冷静  行吧  | I thought we were being cool, but okay. |
| 对了  这样吧  | Hey, here's an idea. |
| 要不你邀请你的朋友来家里吃晚饭吧  | Why don't you invite your new buddy over for dinner? |
| -为什么  -亲爱的  | - Why? - Well, honey, |
| 因为朋友之间就会这样啊  | um, that is what friends do. |
| 我妈妈要我问问你  | My mother asked me to ask you |
| 愿不愿意来我们家共进晚餐  | if you'd like to join us for dinner. |
| -为什么  -我还希望你知道为什么呢  | - Why? - I was hoping you'd know. |
| 他到了  | He's here! |
| 大家保持冷静    | Everybody, stay calm! |
| 只是普通的一天  普通的一顿晚餐  | Just a normal day, just a normal dinner. |
| 我能去电视前吃吗  | Can I eat in front of the TV? |
| 不行  但你可以在谢尔顿朋友的面前吃  | No, you can eat in front of Sheldon's friend. |
| -卧槽  -我知道"卧槽"是什么意思  | - Aw, fudge. - I know what "fudge" means, |
| 你差一点点就要挨削了  小姑娘  | and you are right on the edge, young lady. |
| 欢迎你来  | Welcome. |
| 所以...  | So, uh... |
| 丹  你这是哪国名字  | Tam. What kind of name is that? |
| 是越南名  先生  | Vietnamese. Sir. |
| 懂了  我也曾经在那里待过  | Sure. You know, I spent a little time over there. |
| 我在军队  | Army. |
| 你妈妈的名字不叫金李吧  | Your mom's name isn't Kim-Lee, is it? |
| 不  先生  | No. Sir. |
| 太好了  | Good. |
| 你懂的  小国家嘛  | I mean, you know, it's a small country. |
| 说不定就...  | So... |
| 玛丽  还要多久才能做完  | Mary, how's that food coming? |
| 快啦  | Almost. |
| 越南  就像电影《第一滴血》吗  | So, Vietnam, like in Rambo. |
| 该电影男主角兰博是个越战退伍军人  | 该片的第二部场景是在越南 |
| -是的  -那电影超屌  | - Yes. - That's a cool movie. |
| 是啊  | Yes. |
| 你有在里面演出吗  | Are you in it? |
| 没有  | No. |
| 你为什么会觉得你认识他妈妈  | Why would you think you knew his mom? |
| 好啦  丹  | All right, Tam. |
| 我决定给你做纯正的德州风味晚餐  | I decided I was gonna make you a real Texas dinner. |
| 德州烧烤鸡肉与牛胸肉  | Barbecued chicken and brisket. |
| 谢谢您  | Thank you. |
| 我估计你应该也很烦  | Well, I figured you were probably tired |
| 你吃的东西会在盘子上扭动了  | of stuff wiggling around on your plate. |
| 我们来饭前祷告  | Okay, let's say grace. |
| 丹  当我们说"耶稣"  | Now, Tam, when I say "Jesus," |
| 也欢迎你在你脑海里说"菩萨"  | feel free to say the word "Buddha" in your head. |
| 我其实是信天主教的  | I'm actually Catholic. |
| 那就太不幸了  | Oh. Well, that's too bad. |
| 感谢主  赐予我们桌上的食物  | Thank you, God, for this food, |
| 也保佑准备这餐点的人  | and bless the hands that prepared it. |
| 也感谢您给谢尔顿带来了新朋友  | And thank you so much for Sheldon's new friend. |
| 阿门  | Amen. |
| 丹  跟我们聊聊你的家人啊  | So, Tam, tell us about your family. |
| 你们为什么会来德克萨斯  | What brings y'all to Texas? |
| 在美战结束过后  | Well, after the American War... |
| 你是说越战吧  | You mean the Vietnam War. |
| 我们那里叫美战  | We call it the American War. |
| 然后呢  | Hmm. Anyway, |
| 在战争结束后  我父亲被送去再教育营  | after the war, my father was sent to a reeducation camp |
| 因为他在战时站错边  | because he fought on the wrong side. |
| 错边是指我们这边吧  | You mean our side. |
| 礼貌性不说穿而已  | I was trying to be nice. |
| 所以有很多年  | So, for many years, |
| 我们一家一直都非常穷  | my mother and my sisters and I were very poor |
| 吃不饱是常事  | and very often didn't have much to eat. |
| 最后当我爸爸被放出来后...  | Then, when he was released... |
| 他们在再教育营里都教育他什么了  | What'd they teach him at the reeducation camp? |
| 教他如何成为共产党人  | How to be a communist. |
| 酷啊  就像电影里那样  | Cool, like in Rambo. |
| 当我爸爸被放出来后  | When he was released, |
| 我们坐小船出逃  | we escaped on a small boat |
| 我们在海上漂了几周  一路躲着柬埔寨海盗  | and spent many weeks at sea dodging Cambodian pirates |
| 最终漂到了泰国  | until we reached Thailand. |
| 那里好像是个很美的国家  | Oh, that's supposed to be a beautiful country. |
| -很美的阳光沙滩  -我不知道  | - Lovely beaches. - I wouldn't know. |
| 我们被逼着住进难民营  | We were forced to live in a refugee camp, |
| 我们唯一能吃到的只有鸽子与老鼠  | where the only thing we had to eat were pigeons and rats. |
| 这时候就要靠辣酱了  | Ha! That's a job for hot sauce. |
| 最后  | Finally, |
| 我们被允许来到美国  | we were allowed to come to United States |
