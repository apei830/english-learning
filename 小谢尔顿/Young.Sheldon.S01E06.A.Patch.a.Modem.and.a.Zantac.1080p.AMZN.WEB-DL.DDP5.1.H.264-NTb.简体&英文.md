| 今天有个特别的小礼物给大家  | I have a special treat for y'all today. |
| 我的好友兼以前同事  | My dear friend and former college roommate is here |
| 从休士顿的约翰逊航天中心来这里  | from the Johnson Space Center in Houston |
| 跟我们大家聊聊我国的太空计划  | to talk to us about our space program. |
| 是的  我知道你们都在想什么  | And yeah, I know what you're thinking. |
| 这两个人曾是室友  | These guys were roomies. |
| 怎么会一个就变成了...  | How does one go on to be a.... |
| 太空总署的酷炫科学家  | a fancy scientist at NASA, |
| 而另一个人在教高一科学  | and the other's teaching freshman science |
| 而且还是在公立学校里教  | at a public high school? |
| 怎么了  谢尔顿  | Yeah, Sheldon. |
| 我刚才就在想这个  | I was thinking that. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 好的  让我们用热烈的掌声  | All right, uh, let's give a warm welcome |
| 欢迎我的好兄弟  罗纳尔多·霍奇斯博士  | to my good buddy, Dr. Ronald Hodges. |
| 孩子们  大家好啊  很高兴来到这里    | Hey, kids. Hey. Glad to be here. |
| 回答一下休伯特你的问题    | And, uh, Hubert, the answer to your question is, |
| 其中一个室友忙着读书  | one of those roomies was busy studying |
| 而另一个室友忙着泡高中妹  | while the other was out chasing high school girls. |
| 是的  | Yeah. |
| 我澄清一下  那些姑娘都满18岁了  | To be clear, they were all over 18. |
| 这个嘛...  | Yeah. Well... |
| 来  我觉得今天可以聊的比较有趣的东西  | Now, what I thought would be fun to talk about today |
| 是太空总署除了太空梭之外的计划  | is what NASA's planning on doing beyond the space shuttle. |
| 比如首个上火星的载人航天任务  | Things like the first manned mission to Mars. |
| 你说  | Uh, yeah. |
| 你看了电影《异形》吗  | Did you see the movie Aliens? |
| 看了  | I did. |
| 你觉得那电影酷吗  | Did you think it was cool? |
| 算吧  我看得挺开心  | Sure, I enjoyed it. |
| 我也是  | Me, too. |
| 打橄榄球的吧  | Football player, right? |
| 是的  先生  | Yes, sir. |
| 好  但首先呢  | Now, of course, before |
| 在我们出发去探索太阳系之前  | we can set out to explore the solar system, |
| 有几个小问题我们得先克服  | we've got a few minor problems to overcome. |
| 比方说  首先呢  每一次发射  | Not the least of which is, every time we launch, |
| 都要花掉美国纳税人民  | it costs the U.S. Taxpayers |
| 上亿美元的税金  | hundreds of millions of dollars. |
| 别  别  别啊  | Oh, no, no, no. |
| -你说  -如果你想省钱  | - Yes. - If you want to save money, |
| 为什么不把助推火箭降落回收  | why don't you land the booster rockets |
| 而是随它们降进大海里去呢  | instead of letting them drop in the ocean? |
| 这主意挺有意思    | That's a cute idea, |
| 但技术上来说不可能   | but, uh, it's not technically possible. |
| 为什么不可能  | Why not? |
| 这很难解释  | Well, it's hard to explain. |
| 这其中牵扯到很复杂的数学  | The math is pretty complicated. |
| 说不定我能帮你算算呢  | Perhaps I could help you with it. |
| 我相信你肯定行  | Well, I bet you could. |
| 你肯定行啦  | I'll bet you could. |
| 这样吧  这是个太空总署布贴  | I'll tell you what. Here is a NASA patch. |
| 带回家让你妈妈缝到你书包上吧  | Why don't you have your mom sew that on your book bag? |
| 有谁想要知道太空人怎么上厕所的  | Now, who here wants to know how astronauts go to the bathroom? |
| -我  我想知道  -好    | - Me. I do. - Oh, right. |
| 其实呢  火箭升空时    | See, now, during liftoff, |
| 所有的太空人都穿尿布  | all the astronauts wear diapers. |
| 很多人常会寻思为什么  | People often wonder why I chose |
| 我选择进理论物理学这一领域  | to pursue a career in theoretical physics. |
| 我通常都会回答  | I usually respond by saying |
| 我想要理解宇宙万物运转的核心奥秘  | I wanted to unravel the inner workings of the universe. |
| 所以或许当柯克舰长在剧里说"勇敢前进[大便]"  | Yeah, perhaps when Captain Kirk said, "To boldly go," |
| 或许指的是勇敢拉一泡  | he meant in one of those, huh? |
| 但其实真实的原因是  | But the real answer was |
| 我想要证明这个猪头三错了  | I wanted to prove this nincompoop wrong. |
| 说不定剧里那句是"传送我吧  屎[史]考提"  | Yeah, that's right. Beam me up, Potty! |

| 我今天见了个律师  | So I saw a lawyer today. |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 我在安排我的临终遗嘱  | I'm putting together my last will and testament. |
| 我们会想你的  | We're gonna miss ya. |
| 乔治  | George. |
| 没事  我屁都不会留给他  | Don't worry. I ain't leaving him squat. |
| 你要死了吗  | Are you dyin'? |
| 我们都会死啊  亲爱的  | We're all dyin', honey. |
| 从我们出生的那一刻起  | From the second we're born, |
| 就在慢慢滑向死亡的深渊  | it's just a slip and slide into the darkness. |
| 除非你被吸血鬼咬了  | Unless you get bit by a vampire. |
| 那个还用说吗  | Well, now that goes without saying. |
| 我不想死  我才亲过一个男生而已呢  | I don't want to die. I've only kissed one boy so far. |
| 什么  | What? |
| 别紧张  是很久以前的事了  | Relax. It was a long time ago. |
| 你放心了吗  | Are you relaxed? |
| 谢利  你晚饭一口都还没吃  | Shelly, you haven't touched your dinner. |
| 你没事吧  | You feel okay? |
| 没事  我只是在想事情  | Oh, yes. I was just thinking. |
| 想什么呢  宝贝  | About what, baby? |
| 可回收再利用的火箭的最佳高度与宽度比  | The optimal height-to-width ratio for a reusable rocket. |
| 我刚才也在想这件事呢  | I was just thinking the exact same thing. |
| 真的吗  | Really? |
| 小饼饼  我真是爱死你了  | Oh, Moonpie, I love you so much. |
| 很晚了  你不睡在干嘛  | It's late. What are you doing up? |
| 我正在弄火箭回收降落时的双曲线计算  | I'm working on the hyperbolic calculations for a rocket return. |
| 需要帮忙吗  | Need any help? |
| 什么  | What? |
| 开玩笑的    | I'm kiddin'. |
| 关灯上床睡吧  | Now, turn out the light and go to bed. |
| -可是...  -快去  | - But... - Now. |
| 爸爸  我们买得起电脑吗  | Dad, can we afford a computer? |
| 我的税务是你在弄的  你觉得呢  | You do my taxes. What do you think? |
| 那没事了  | Never mind. |
| 晚安  | Good night. |
| 姥姥  | Meemaw? |
| 小饼饼先生  有何能为你效劳  | Mr. Moonpie, how might I help you? |
| 您去世后准备留下多少钱给我  | How much money are you planning to leave me when you die? |
| 有缘再相会  | Nice talkin' to you. |
| 姥姥  | Meemaw? |
| 要重新修改你的用词吗  | Want to try that again? |
| 我想要买台电脑  | I need to buy a computer |
| 好解出纳维-斯托克斯方程  | so I can solve the Navier-Stokes equation. |
| 那一台电脑多少钱  | Uh-huh. How much is a computer? |
| 苹果有一台不错的要两千块  | Apple has a nice one for $2,000, |
| 但我需要的那种要三百万  | but the kind I need costs three million. |
| 让我看看我小金库里有多少钱  | Let me see what I got in the vault. |
| 9块钱外加...  | Nine bucks and, uh... |
| 瞧瞧  是墨西哥披索  | Oh, look at that-- a peso. |
| 还带着体温  | It's warm. |
| 您好  第一国家银行  | Hello, First National Bank. |
| 我想要跟一位信贷员谈谈  | I'd like to speak with a loan officer. |
| 是跟我家屋子的二次抵押有关  | It's regarding a second mortgage on my home. |
| 我的名字叫谢尔顿·李·库珀  | My name is Sheldon Lee Cooper. |
| 好  我可以等  | Sure, I'll hold. |
| 我讨厌死等待铃声了  | Oh, I hate hold music. |
| 你好  | Hello. |
| 是的  你能帮到我  桃乐丝·菲茨帕特里克  | Yes, you can help me, Dorothy Fitzpatrick. |
| 我有兴趣将房子二次抵押  | I'm interested in taking out a second mortgage. |
| 我9岁  为什么这么问  | I'm nine years old. Why do you ask? |
| 你这是年龄歧视  桃乐丝  | That's called age discrimination, Dorothy, |
| 但我大人不记小人过  | but I'm willing to let it slide. |
| 你觉得我可爱是好事  但我是认真的  | I'm glad you find me cute, but I'm deadly serious. |
| 我需要资金来买电脑  | I need funds to buy a computer. |
| 不  房子不是在我名下  | No, the house isn't in my name. |
| 我9岁  我们已经确认过这件事了  | I'm nine. We've established this. |
| 但我父母的税都是我在帮忙报的  | I do prepare the taxes for my parents, |
| 如果我们勒紧裤带  | and if we tighten our belts, |
| 抵押资产的净值足够我们申请贷款  | we'll have sufficient equity for the loan. |
| 谢尔顿你在跟谁说话  | Sheldon, who are you talking to? |
| 桃乐丝·菲茨帕特里克  | Dorothy Fitzpatrick. |
| 桃乐丝·菲茨帕特里克是谁  | Who's Dorothy Fitzpatrick? |
| 是你学校新认识的女同学吗  | Is she a new buddy from school? |
| 她是梅德福第一国家银行的信贷员  | She's the loan officer at The First National Bank of Medford. |
| 你为什么在跟她说话  | Why are you talking to her? |
| 妈  能等会儿在说吗  | Mom, can this wait? |
| 我在跟她谈有利条件呢  | I'm trying to negotiate favorable terms. |
| 还在吗  桃乐丝  | Hello. Dorothy? |
| 你怎么没去上数学课  | Hey, how come you weren't in math class? |
| 太空总署来的那个人把我当小孩对待  | That guy from NASA treated me like a child, |
| 我要证明他是错的  | and I need to prove him wrong. |
| 你就是个小孩啊  | You are a child. |
| 小心说话啊  朋友  | Tread lightly, my friend. |
| 英格拉姆女士有因为我翘课不高兴吗  | Was Ms. Ingram upset I wasn't in class? |
| 她其实挺高兴呢  | Actually, she was happy. |
| 她还手足舞蹈了一会儿  | She even did a little dance. |
| 你知道谁那里有路由器吗  | Do you know anybody with a modem? |
| 睿侠电器行应该有  怎么了  | I think Radio Shack has one. Why? |
| 我需要进约翰逊航天中心的  | I need to access thrust-to-weight ratios |
| ftp服务器来得到推力重量比数据  | from the FTP server at the Johnson Space Center. |
| 之后呢  | Then what? |
| 给太空总署的那人看我的计算啊  | Then I show that guy from NASA my work |
| 然后嘲笑在我面前俯首称臣的他  | and laugh as he begs for mercy. |
| 有时候你说话像个邪恶魔王  | You know, sometimes you sound like a super villain. |
| 安静  | Silence! |
| 等你长大变声后再说会比较有用  | That'll be more effective after your voice changes. |
| 安静  | Silence. |
| 妈  你能带我去睿侠电器行吗  | Mom, can you take me to Radio Shack? |
| 今天不行  | Not today, baby. |
| 我得先去买菜然后开始做晚饭  | I have to go food shopping and get dinner started. |
| 但我有重要的事  | But it's important. |
| 对不起啦  等周末看看吧  | Sorry. Maybe over the weekend. |
| 但我用不了多少时间啊  | But it won't take that long. |
| 谢尔顿  我说了不行  | Sheldon, I said no. |
| -妈  -不许再说  | - But, Mom... - Not another word. |
| 笑什么  | What? |
| 我穷开心不行吗  | Can't I just be happy? |
| 妈妈  拜托了  | Mom, please! |
| 谢尔顿·李  我说了不行  | Sheldon Lee, I said no. |
| 我还在开心呢  | I'm still happy. |
| 求你了  妈  你这样很不公平  | Please, Mom! You're being unfair! |
| -还是不行  -但我真的很需要推重比数据  | - No. - But I really need those thrust-to-weight ratios. |
| 你没看到我在做饭吗  | Do you see I'm cookin'? |
| 那晚饭后带我去嘛  | Well, take me after dinner. |
| 别再说了  今晚我哪里都不会带你去  | Enough! I'm not takin' you anywhere tonight. |
| 我并不引以为豪  | I'm not proud of it, |
| 我小时候  曾经也...  | but as a child, I was prone... |
| 偶尔会气到爆炸  | to the occasional meltdown. |
| 香蕉你个大西瓜  | Cheese and crackers! |
| 抱歉让你听到这污言秽语  | I'm sorry you had to hear that. |
| 好啦  我终于把他安抚好了  | All right, I finally got him calmed down. |
| 你怎么做到的  | How'd you manage that? |
| 很简单  给他个拥抱再喂一点感冒糖浆  | Easy. Gave him a hug and a little cough syrup. |
| 妈  | Mom! |
| 他又不用操作重型机械  嗜睡没事的  | It's not like he's operating heavy machinery. |
| 我们不能让他这么闹下去  | We can't keep putting up with this behavior. |
| -我们得禁足他  -怎么禁足  | - We need to ground him. - How? |
| 你跟他说"不许你出去玩了"  | If you say "No playing outside," |
| 他会说"谢谢"  | he says, "Thank you." |
| 我们总得管教他吧  | Well, we need to do something. |
| 就是闹脾气嘛  孩子都会这样  | It's just a tantrum. It's what kids do. |
| 你以前整天处罚我啊  | You used to punish me all the time. |
| 那不一样  你当年就是欠揍  | That was different. You were a pain in the ass. |
| 要不一个月不许去睿侠电器行  | I say no Radio Shack for at least a month. |
| 我看行  | Sounds fair. |
| 我去跟他说吧  | I'll go tell him. |
| 要我就会等到明天再说  | I'd wait and tell him tomorrow. |
| 他现在有点昏沉  | He's a little loopy right now. |
| 晚安啦  | Good night. |
| 她用药弄晕了我们儿子  | She drugged our son. |
| 之后开始了我人生最漫长的一个月  | Thus began the longest month of my life. |
| 失去了得到推重比数据的能力  | Without the ability to access the thrust-to-weight ratios, |
| 我周密的羞辱太空总署科学家大计  | my well-intended effort to humiliate a NASA scientist |
| 受到了严重阻碍  | ground to a halt. |
| 妈  | Mom. |
| 怎么了  | Uh... what's going on? |
| 谢尔顿好像不舒服  | Something's wrong with Sheldon. |
| 怎么啦  儿子  肚子疼吗  | What's the matter, baby? Have a tummy ache? |
| 有可能是胃溃疡  | I think it's an ulcer. |
| 别犯傻了  | Don't be silly. |
| -你肯定是吃错什么了  -才不是  | - You must have eaten something. - No. |
| 我的症状符合胃溃疡的病徴  | My symptoms are consistent with an ulcer. |
| 谢利  还记得你以为自己得了麻风病  | Shelly, remember when you thought you had leprosy, |
| 结果只是有块皮肤有点干吗  | and it was just a patch of dry skin? |
| 还有你以为自己得了痛风  或前列腺肿大  | And when you thought you had gout? Or an enlarged prostate? |
| 还有疯牛症  | Or mad cow? |
| 那次是我的最爱  | That was my favorite. |
| 这次真的不一样  | Well, this is different. |
| 或许我们该带他去看医生  | Maybe we should take him to the doctor. |
| 听你老婆的话啊  胃溃疡是很严重的  | Listen to your wife-- ulcers are serious. |
| 我从没在这么小的病人身上看到  | Well, I've never seen this in someone so young, |
| 但你儿子的确是得了胃溃疡  | but, uh, your son has an ulcer. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 怎么会这样  | How could this happen? |
| 有好几个可能因素  | Uh, there are a number of factors. |
| 他最近有遭受什么特殊的压力吗  | Has he been under some unusual stress lately? |
| 有  她不带我去睿侠电器行  | Yes. She won't take me to Radio Shack. |
| 去外面等  | Go wait outside. |
| 我听过一些有趣的研究  | I've heard some interesting research |
| 说用抗菌剂可以治胃溃疡  | about treating ulcers with antimicrobials. |
| 出去  | Go. |
| 你还好意思惊讶我得了胃溃疡  | And you're surprised I have an ulcer. |
| 我还惊讶我为什么没得呢  | I'm surprised I don't have one. |
| 睿侠电器行是怎么回事  | Um, Radio Shack? |
| 他想算出怎么帮忙太空总署回收火箭  | He's trying to figure out how to help NASA land rockets. |
| 这挺不错的啊  | Oh. Well, that's a nice thing. |
| 但他是为了报仇才这么做  | He's just doing it out of spite. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 这段期间别让他吃辣的食物  | Well, keep him off spicy foods for the time being, |
| 我再给你开胃溃疡药的处方签  | and I'll write you a prescription for Zantac. |
| 他抽烟吗  | Does he smoke? |
| 当然不抽  他才9岁  | 'Course not. He's nine. |
| 我在他这年纪就开始抽了  | I started at his age. |
| 但只有在我喝酒时才抽  | Uh, but only when I drank. |
| 什么...  | What the...? |
| 谢尔顿  你在干嘛  | Sheldon! What are you doing? |
| 给我一分钟就好  这玩意太慢了  | I just need a minute. These things are so slow. |
| 这是你的家人吗  | Is this your family? |
| 感觉人都好棒  | They're lovely. |
| -妈妈  -怎么了  | - Mom. - What? |
| 谢尔顿又有毛病了  | There's something wrong with Sheldon again. |
| 我算出来了  | I figured it out! |
| 我算出来了  | I figured it out! |
| 一晚  | One night. |
| 我就想好好睡一晚  | I want to sleep one night. |
| 妈  你来啦  | Oh. Hi, Mom. |

| 靠  我真是受够了  | Damn it. I've had enough of this. |
| 谢尔顿  起来  | Sheldon, get up. |
| 起来有何意义  | What's the point? |
| 我们去休士顿  | We're going to Houston. |

| 好好上一课  | a little talkin' to. |
| 我时常觉得我父亲  | I often found my father to be |
| 是个奇怪又令人不解的男人  | a strange and puzzling man, |
| 但在那一刻  我从未如此爱过他    | but at that moment, I never loved him more. |
| 为什么我不能待在家啊  | I don't see why I couldn't stay home. |
| 因为我们要来一次快乐家庭出游  | 'Cause we're having a fun family outin'. |
| 好歹让我开车吧  | Can I at least drive? |
| 你妈是说快乐  不是快死  | She said fun, not tragic. |
| 我们去那个鸵鸟园吧  | Let's go to the ostrich farm. |
| 太酷了  | Cool. |
| 我们可以骑着它们遛几圈  再宰了吃  | We can ride 'em, and then we can eat 'em. |
| 我们哪儿都不停  | We're not stopping anywhere. |
| 直接去休斯顿把你弟弟的事儿整明白  | We're going to Houston to straighten this thing out for your brother, |
| 然后就回家  | then we're going home. |
| 谢利  你还好吧  | Shelly, you doing okay? |
| 还好  但愿我不会晕车  | Yes. I just hope I don't get carsick. |
| 想让爸爸停一会儿吗  | You want Daddy to pull over? |
| 我没事的  | I'll be okay. |
| 天啊  他吐到我鞋子上了  我的鞋上  | Oh, God, it's on my shoes, it's on my shoes! |
| 老天爷啊  谁来开个窗  | For Pete's sake, somebody open a window. |
| 我无意冒犯  | Yeah, I don't mean to be rude, |
| 不过我们等见你上司已经一小时了  | but we've been waitin' for an hour to see your boss. |
| 对不起  先生  | I'm sorry, sir, |
| 你们没有预约就来了  | but you didn't have an appointment. |
| 我们没有预约的原因是每次我打来  | We didn't have an appointment 'cause every time I called, |
| 你就会让我稍候  | you put me on hold. |
| 我确信霍奇斯博士会尽快见你们的  | I'm sure Dr. Hodges'll see you as soon as he can. |
| -你打算怎么办  -我也不知道  | - So, what do you want to do? - I don't know. |
| 只能耐心等着吧...  | I guess we just got to be patient and wait... |
| 见鬼去吧  | Aw, screw it! |
| 抱歉  先生  你不能就这样...  | Excuse me, sir, you can't just... |
| 你给我听好了  | All right, here's the deal. |
| 我的孩子因为你  患上了胃溃疡  | My kid's got a damn ulcer 'cause of you, |
| 所以你要么认真对待他  | so either you take him seriously, |
| 要么就想想怎么对付我  | or you're gonna be taking me seriously. |
| 请吩咐  先生  | Yes, sir? |
| 珍妮丝  不如请那位小伙子进来吧  | Janice, why don't you send the little boy in? |
| 快快有请  | Right away. |
| 他可以见你了  | He'll see you now. |

| 我还没讲完  | I'm not done. |

| 我们必须使用比例-积分-微分控制器来尽量减少  | we use a P.I.D. Controller to minimize the dispersions |
| 着陆点的散布范围  | to the landing site. |
| 还有别的吗  | Anything else? |
| 有  我想喝水  | Yes. I'd like a glass of water. |
| 我该吃胃溃疡药了  | It's time to take my Zantac. |
| 他进去好一会儿了  | He's been in there quite a while. |
| 只要话题关乎科学  | Well, if the topic is science, |
| 他就是个小话唠  | he can be a really Chatty Patty. |
| 无聊死了  | I'm bored. |
| 我也觉得  | Me, too. |
| 未来会有人给谢尔顿写本书  | Someday somebody's gonna write a book about Sheldon. |
| 你们不想看到里面某个章节  | Don't you want there to be a chapter |
| 写你们俩是多有爱地支持他吗  | about how loving and supportive you two were? |
| 我无所谓  反正我也不会看  | Doesn't matter. I ain't reading it. |
| 你的成果极具开创性  | This is groundbreaking work. |
| 谢谢  还有呢  | Thank you. And...? |
| 还有什么  | And...? |
| 我以为你会想道歉  | I thought you might want to apologize. |
| 为什么要道歉  | Why? |
| 你想用一个布贴让我闭嘴  | You tried to shut me up with a patch. |
| 我...我见人就送布贴  | Well... I-I give those to everyone. |
| 还有你得明白  谢尔顿  | A-And you have to understand, Sheldon, |
| 虽然你的计算在理论上是正确的  | that while your math is-is theoretically correct, |
| 但是我们没有技术能力来执行它  | we don't have the technical capability to execute it. |
| 所以我走在时代前头了吗  | So I'm ahead of my time? |
| 看来是这样  | Well... it would appear so. |
| 好吧  等你们水平赶上来再联系我  | All right, call me when you catch up. |
| 我们可以走了  | We can go now. |
| 我时常深思  如果那一天我父亲  | I've often contemplated what might have happened |
| 没有为我挺身而出  一切会变成什么样  | if my father hadn't stuck up for me that day. |
| 我会继续在科学道路上前行  | Would I have gone on to become |
| 成为世界级的理论物理学家  | a world-class theoretical physicist, |
| 还是那种平庸的蓝领理论物理学家  | or just your average Joe Sixpack theoretical physicist? |
| 爸爸  | Dad? |
| 怎么了  | Yeah? |
| 谢谢你  | Thank you. |
| 不用谢  | You're welcome. |
| 我们为你骄傲  亲爱的  | We're real proud of you, honey. |
| -你们也为我和小乔治骄傲吗  -当然了  | - Are you proud of me and Georgie? - Of course. |
| 当然  | You bet. |
| 骄傲什么  | For what? |
| 见好就收吧  | Don't go pokin' at it. |
