| 接下来  | Moving on. |
| 隐喻与明喻就不一样了  | Metaphors are different from similes. |
| 很多人都说我有洁癖  | I've been called a germophobe, |
| 但我觉得打个喷嚏还是可以忍受的  | but I do find a single sneeze acceptable. |
| 有可能是因为灰尘  过敏  | It could be caused by dust, allergies-- |
| 或者各种能让你呼吸道不适的东西  | really, whatever nasal irritant floats your boat. |
| 但是呢...  | However... |
| 在流感季节  | during flu season... |
| 打第二个喷嚏就代表要天降瘟疫了  | ...a second sneeze means a plague is upon the land, |
| 所有人只能自求多福   | and it's every man for himself. |
| 你要去哪里  | Where do you think you're going? |
| 远离你  | Away from you. |
| 为什么  | Why's that? |
| 我还想活着  | I want to live. |
| 我没生病  回座位坐好  | I'm not sick. Get back in your seat. |
| 不用了  谢谢  | No, thank you. |
| 你懂校规  | You know the rules. |
| 没有同意证不许离开教室  | You can't leave without a hall pass. |
| 那我能要一张同意证吗  | May I have a hall pass? |
| 不行  不给  | No, you may not. |

| 规矩是文明社会的柱石  | Rules are the pillars of society. |

| 请问一下  | Excuse me. |
| 我看起来像是要生病了吗  | Do I look like I'm getting sick to you? |
| 你看起来有点苍白  | You look a little pale. |
| 那太好了  一切正常  | Okay, good, that's normal. |
| 我知道谢尔顿是个非凡的孩子  | Now, I understand Sheldon is an exceptional child, |
| 话虽如此  但是呢  | all right, but |
| 当他故意违抗老师的命令时  | when he willfully disobeys the order of a teacher, |
| 得让他明白会有什么后果  | there needs to be some consequences here. |
| 我们完全同意  | Oh, we couldn't agree more. |
| 您打算给他什么样的惩罚  | What kind of punishment are you thinking? |
| 玛丽  他这样的情况大概是几天留校察看  | Well, Mary, in a case like this, a few days of detention. |
| 真的吗  有点重了吧  | Really? That seems a little harsh. |
| 留校察看没那么严重啦  | Oh, detention's no big deal. |
| 我当年的校长还用拍子打我屁股呢  | Now, my principal used to whup my ass with a paddle. |
| 那可让我学乖了  | That got my attention. |
| 对啊  当年那好日子啊  | Oh, yeah. Those were the days. |
| 我的拍子还在  | Still have mine. |
| 三尺宝拍  | Ol' Spanky. |
| -握把很不错啊  -是啊  乔治  | - Got a real nice grip on that thing. ‭- Yeah, George. |
| 专门请别地方的设备经理为我打造  | Had the equipment manager over at the Astros make this for me. |
| 中间这些孔洞  | The holes in it... |
| 能有效减低风阻  | cut down on wind resistance. |
| 高招  | Smart. |
| 但现在要打孩子得有家长同意函了  | But these days you have to have a consent form |
| 取得同意才能打  | to whack the kids. |
| 真不知道这世界要变成怎么样啊  | I don't know where this world's headed. |
| 等小乔治不乖  你也去搞一只这个  | You ought to get one of those for when Georgie acts up. |
| 干嘛一副你从来没想过请小乔治  | Like you never thought about going upside his head |
| 吃一顿饱拳的样子  | with a slab of wood. |
| 想当年啊  挥这拍子都挥到得网球肘了  | You know, there was a time this thing gave me tennis elbow. |
| 谢尔顿  来...  | Okay, Sheldon, come o... |
| 他去哪里了  | Where'd he go? |
| 那边  | Thataway. |
| 你干嘛呢  小屁孩  | What you doing, kid?! |
| 好好享受这一幕    | Enjoy this. It is, by far, |
| 这是我此生运动量最大的两分钟了  | the most athletic two minutes of my entire life. |
| 不好笑好吗  | It's not funny. |
| 哪里不好笑了  | Oh, come on, now. |
| 谢尔顿被留校察看  笑死了  | Sheldon in detention-- that's funny. |
| 我觉得这其实对会对他有帮助  | I actually think it'd be good for him. |
| 他得学到他并不特别  | He needs to learn he's not special. |
| 但他就是特别的孩子啊  | But he is special. |
| 你知道我不是这意思  他不能  | You know what I mean. He can't just |
| 想走出教室就走出教室啊  他没有特权  | walk out of a classroom 'cause he feels like it. |
| 他是担心会感冒  | He was worried about catching a cold. |
| 这是个很合理的忧虑  | That is a legitimate concern. |
| 而现在他陷入了被一屋子小流氓  | And now he's in danger of being mugged |
| 勒索抢劫的危险当中了  | by a roomful of hoodlums. |
| 他不会被勒索好吗  | He's not getting mugged. |
| 也就是几个孩子在教室写作业  | It's half a dozen kids doing homework |
| 然后有老师盯着他们  | while a teacher watches 'em. |
| 不过你给谢尔顿身上留几块钱也不是坏事  | Although it might not hurt to give Sheldon a few dollars |
| 给他自己留点买命钱  | to buy himself some protection. |
| 这主意还真不坏  | That's actually not a bad idea. |
| 你在干嘛  | What are you doing? |
| 没干嘛  | Nothing. |
| 那是嚼用烟草吗  | Is that chewing tobacco? |
| 是口香糖  你找我干嘛  | It's chocolate Bazooka. What do you want? |
| 我明天要被留校察看  | I have detention tomorrow, |
| 我觉得你可以给我一点建议  | and I thought you could give me some tips. |
| 你还蛮屌的  就这么直接走出教室  | That was pretty badass, you walking out of class like that. |
| 我不是故意想要那么"刁"  不过谢谢夸奖  | It was not my intention to be bad "a" word, but thank you. |
| 留校察看你唯一需要担心的一件事就是  | The only thing you need to worry about in detention |
| 就是离老师不够近  | is staying close to the teacher. |
| 当老师离开教室时  记得跟着他  | If he leaves the room, you go with him. |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 你不跟着他  你小心被人"吊"起来打  | 'Cause you're gonna get your "a" word kicked. |
| 你的意思是我可能受到人身伤害吗  | Are you saying I'll be in physical danger? |
| 全校最坏的孩子  | It's all the worst kids in school |
| 放学后被留在一个教室里一小时  | in one room for an hour. |
| 你觉得会发生什么事  | What do you think's gonna happen? |
| 我还以为我们要用那段时间反省自己  | I thought we were gonna spend the time regretting our actions |
| 然后想出我们未来该如何改进  | and thinking about how we could be better in the future. |
| 你想错了  退下吧  | Well, you thought wrong. Get lost. |
| 你对我又凶又好  | You're both mean and nice to me. |
| 好让人搞不懂啊  | It's confusing. |
| 或许我嚼法错了  | Maybe I'm doing this wrong. |
| 你被留校察看过吗  | Have you ever been in detention? |
| 没有  | No. |
| 不过我每天都是坐校车上学  | But I do take the school bus. |
| 车上也不是慈善之家  | And that is no party. |
| 更像是移动精神病院  | It's like a mental hospital on wheels. |
| 你这个明喻用得很好  | That's a good use of simile. |
| 谢谢  | Thanks. |
| 好啦  明天见吧  | Well, I'll see you tomorrow. |
| 希望吧  | I hope. |
| 大家好  我是来留校察看的  | Hello. I'm here for detention. |
| 老师在哪里呢  | Where is the teacher? |
| 还没到  | Not here yet. |
| 我有三块钱  | I have three dollars. |
| 欢迎你跟其他人分  | Feel free to share it with the others. |
| 你会想要写纸上吗  | Would you prefer a piece of paper? |
| 我手提箱里有一些  | I have some in my briefcase. |
| 改变心意了告诉我就行  | It's here if you change your mind. |
| 好啦  废柴们  规矩大家都懂  | All right, losers, you know how this works. |
| 一个小时  不许说话  不许捣蛋  | One hour, no talking, no horseplay. |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon? |
| 你好啊  吉文斯老师  | Hello, Mr. Givens. |
| 你怎么在这里  | Why are you here? |
| 我不想被马克艾罗伊夫人传染感冒  | I didn't want to catch a cold from Ms. MacElroy, |
| 尽管她没给许可证  我还是走出了她课堂  | so I left her classroom without a hall pass. |
| 的确是有病在到处传  | Well, something is going around. |
| 我的嗓子眼也有点痒  | I actually had a little tickle in my throat. |
| 好吧  我该走了  很高兴认识你  | Okay, time to go. Nice meeting you. |
| 你这是干什么  | Whoa, what-what are you doing? |
| 你听过"战或逃"吗  | You've heard of fight or flight? |
| 我现在是逃  | This is flight. |
| 现在不那么好笑了吧  | Not so funny now, is it? |
| -是的  -他被停课多久  | - No. - How long is he suspended for? |
| 一周  | A week. |
| 而且这事会永久记录在他档案里  | And it goes on his permanent record. |
| 那没什么大不了  | Well, that's no big deal. |
| 我高中时期永久记录在案的事情多了  | I had all kinds of stuff on my permanent high school record. |
| 那也没妨碍我当了八年的酒保啊  | Didn't stop me from being a bartender for eight years. |
| 我觉得真正需要处理的事情是细菌恐惧症  | I think the real issue we need to deal with is his germ phobia. |
| 是啊  你可不想他变成霍华德·休斯  | Oh, yes, you don't want him turning into Howard Hughes. |
| 美国企业家及演员  晚年出现精神强迫症和洁癖    | 一年剪一次指甲和头发 |
| 指甲那么老长  | Growing his nails out. |
| 尿在罐子里  | Peeing in a jar. |
| -他为什么要尿罐子里  -我怎么知道为什么  | - Why would he pee into a jar? - I don't know why he peed in a jar, |
| 反正他就是这么做  | I just know he did. |
| 我真不想这么说  | I hate to say it, |
| 但我觉得这种情况我们需要帮手  | but I think we need help with this. |
| 什么帮手  | Like what? |
| 或许带他去看能让他冷静下来的那好医生  | Maybe we could take him to that nice doctor who calmed him down |
| 就是谢尔顿确信自己前列腺肥大那次  | when he was convinced he had an enlarged prostate? |
| 谢尔顿之所以冷静下来是因为医生告诉他  | Sheldon only calmed down when the doctor told him |
| 前列腺检查需要做些什么事  | what happens in a prostate exam. |
| 可怜的小家伙  | Poor thing. |
| 现在有时还在念叨那事  | Still talks about it. |
| 谢谢你抽时间见我们  医生  | Thank you for seeing us, Doctor. |
| 不客气  | No problem. |
| 今天你是什么病啊  谢尔顿  | So, what do you got today, Sheldon? |
| 佝偻病   狂犬病  | Rickets? Rabies? |
| 早发性更年期  | Early-onset menopause? |
| 他是在开玩笑吗  | Is he making a joke? |
| 我觉得是  | I believe so. |
| 真幽默  | Humorous. |
| 谢尔顿没病  | Sheldon's not sick, |
| 但他对染上感冒或流感的后果有点过度恐慌  | but he has become overly concerned with getting a cold or the flu. |
| 有什么症状吗  流鼻涕  浑身酸痛  | Well, any symptoms-- runny nose, achy, |
| -喉咙痛  发热  -没有  | - sore throat, fever? - No. |
| 好吧  谢尔顿  就算你真感冒了  | All right, well, Sheldon, if you do catch a cold, |
| 或得了流感  那也不是世界末日啊  | or even the flu, it's... it's not the end of the world. |
| 1918年流感肆虐时期  对死去的  | The flu was the end of the world for half a million Americans |
| 50万美国人来说  流感就是世界末日  | during the influenza epidemic of 1918. |
| -是吗  -在印度  | - Really? - In India |
| 1700万人因此丧命  | 17 million people died. |
| 好吧  我们有点岔题了  | Okay, I think we're getting off the subject. |
| 医生  谢尔顿害怕上学  | Doctor, Sheldon is afraid to go to school |
| 因为他觉得自己可能会  | because he might get exposed |
| 接触到某些细菌或病毒  | to some kind of bacteria or virus. |
| 所以他有恐惧症吗  | So he's got a phobia? |
| 如果威胁是真的  这就不是恐惧症  | It's not a phobia if the threat is real. |
| 您是医生  您应该知道这一点  | You're a doctor, you should know that. |
| 谢尔顿  你没什么可担心的  | Sheldon, you have nothing to worry about. |
| 就算你真得了流感  | Even if you did get the flu, |
| 通常一周内就会好了  | it's usually over in a week. |
| 为什么我们要听一个抽烟的人的医学建议  | Why are we getting medical advice from a man who smokes? |
| -谢尔顿  -好了  | - Sheldon. - O-Okay, |
| 我要去治真正生病的病人了  | I have patients who are actually sick. |
| 或许我们该说再见了  | Maybe we should wrap this up. |
| 你怎么能不被整天传染而生病呢  | How come you don't get sick all the time? |
| 因为我预防措施做得好  | Well, I take precautions. |
| 我勤洗手  戴手套和面罩  | I wash my hands, I wear gloves and a mask. |
| 妈  你今天过得怎么样  | So, Mom, how was your day? |
| 我们要假装看不见吗  | We're ignoring this? |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 真漂亮  | So pretty. |
| 怎么回事  | What's going on? |
| 我感觉不太舒服  | I'm not feeling so good. |
| 生物危害  生化危机  | Biohazard! Biohazard! |
| 笨蛋  | Sucker. |
| 国际新闻  | In national news, |
| 早发不常规流感季正侵袭我们国家  | an unusually early flu season is buffeting the country. |
| 医生说流感病毒株源自中国  | Doctors say the strain, originating in China, |
| 这次尤其严重  | is particularly severe. |
| 孩子和老人为高危人群  | Children and the elderly are most at risk. |
| 谢尔顿  你怎么还不睡  | Sheldon, why are you still up? |
| 我们都会死掉  | We're all gonna die! |
| 这一点都不好笑  | This isn't funny! |
| 我知道  宝贝  我知道  | I know, baby, I know. |
| 可你得明白有时候  | But you need to understand that sometimes |
| 新闻只是危言耸听而已  | the news says those things just to scare people. |
| 那它达到目的了  | Well, it's working! |
| 过来  | Come here. |
| 我知道你不相信这个  | I know you don't believe in this, |
| 但我还是要这么做  | but I'm gonna do it anyway. |
| 主啊  我为我儿谢尔顿祈祷  | Lord, I pray for my son Sheldon |
| 请你保护他免受一切病痛与疾病  | that you protect him from all illness and disease, |
| 护他健康  保他周全  | and keep him healthy and keep him safe, |
| 请你保护好他  从头到脚  | and protect him from his head to his toes, |
| 从里到外  阿门  | inside and out. Amen. |
| 你说得对  我是不相信这个  | You're right. I don't believe in that. |
| 但的确让我感觉好多了  谢谢  | But it did feel good. Thanks. |
| 在《圣经》里  这叫保护层  | In the Bible, that's called a hedge of protection. |
| 你为什么一直在笑  | Why do you keep smiling? |
| 宝贝  你得看看自己的口罩  | You need to look at your mask, baby. |
| 米希  | Missy?! |
| 我们得去上学  而谢尔顿却不用  | We have to go to school, and Sheldon doesn't? |
| -这不公平  -当然  | - That's not fair. - Sure it is. |
| 谢尔顿喜欢学校却不能去  | Sheldon loves school and can't go. |
| 你讨厌学习却必须去  公平  | You hate school and have to. Fair. |
| 他还是得在家做家务  | He still has to spend his day doing chores. |
| 不能光闲着玩他的火车  | Can't sit around playing with his trains. |
| 是啊  让他工作  好家教  老爸  | Yeah, put him to work. Good parenting, Dad. |
| 我很高兴你赞成  | Oh, I'm glad you approve. |
| 是的  | I do. |
| 你去哪里  | Where you going? |
| 我去给谢尔顿安排家务活啊  | I'm gonna give Sheldon a list of chores. |
| 你真的采纳了我的建议吗  | You're actually taking my advice? |
| 是的  | Yes. |
| 真想不到  | Well, how about that? |
| 你的建议合理啊  | Hey, you were due. |
| 为你骄傲  乔治  | Proud of you, George. |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon? |
| 在  | Yes. |
| 门锁了  你能打开吗  | The door's locked. Can you open it? |
| 不行  | No. |
| 搞什么  | What on earth? |
| -你好  -你在干什么  | - Hello. - What are you doing? |
| 我做了一个无菌的保护层  | I made a real germ-proof hedge of protection. |
| 亲爱的  你不能住在里面啊  | Oh, honey, you can't stay in there. |
| 我有冰箱  还有我的睡袋  | I've got a refrigerator, I've got my sleeping bag, |
| 如果我需要其他东西  都可以用乐高造  | and anything else I need I can make out of Legos. |
| 那你穿着万圣节的衣服干嘛  | What's with the Halloween costume? |
| 以防无菌层受到入侵  | In case of a breach. |
| 待在那别动  | Stay right there. |
| 正有此意  | That's my plan. |
| 乔治  | George? |
| 就在你认为他要转变的时候  | Just when you think he's gonna zig, |
| 他给你来了个大逆转  | you get a big old zag. |
| 真是荒谬  我要把这扯掉  | It's ridiculous. I'm... I'm gonna take it down. |
| 不行  你不能强迫他走出恐惧症  | No, you can't force him out of a phobia. |
| 我们该怎么做  | What do we do? |
| 他不能住在里面  | He can't live in there. |
| 事实上  他可以  | Well, actually, he can. |
| 他有冰箱和睡袋  | He's got the refrigerator and a sleeping bag. |
| 而且他随时可以在水槽里上厕所  | And he can always go potty in the sink. |
| 我去送孩子们上学吧  | I think I'll take the kids to school. |
| 你回家时他一定已经出来了  | I'm sure he'll be out by the time you get home. |
| 不知道你为何如此天真  但行吧  | Not sure why you think that, but okay. |
| -妈妈  -什么事  谢利   | - Mom? - Yes, Shelly. |
| 你能关门吗  | Can you close the door? |
| 我要"用水槽"  | I need to use the sink. |
| -谭美·库克  -到  | - Tammy Cook? - ‭Here. |
| -小乔治·库珀  -到  | - Georgie Cooper? - Here. |
| 谢尔顿·库珀  缺席  | Sheldon Cooper? Absent. |
| -你弟弟呢  -在家  | - Where's your brother? - ‭Home. |
| 他没事吧  | Is he okay? |
| 没事  他只是...  | Yeah, he's just... |
| 其实  他情况不乐观  | Actually, it's not looking good for him. |
| 他可能挺不过去了  | He might not make it. |
| -那太糟糕了  -是啊  | - Oh, that's terrible. ‭- I know. |
| 我真的很爱他  | I love him so much. |
| 如果他有三长两短  我真不知道该怎么办  | If anything ever happened, I don't know what I'd do. |
| 谢利  我能问问你吗  | Shelly, if you don't mind me asking, |
| 你的长远计划是什么  | what's your long-term plan here? |
| 我在计算如何将车库  | ‭I'm working on the math to turn the garage |
| 变为自我维持的生态系统  | into a self-sustaining ecosystem. |
| 好吧  那到底是什么意思  | Okay. And what exactly does that mean? |
| 我只需阳光和一些种子  就能有无限食物  | Well, all I need is sunlight and a few seeds to grow unlimited food |
| 我还会用自己的粪便来施肥  | which I'll fertilize with my own feces. |
| 这越来越好玩了  | This just gets better. |
| 如果你不打算帮忙  就进屋里去  | If you're not gonna help, please go inside. |
| 这不是娱乐节目  | This is not a show. |
| 这我就不同意了  | Now that's where I disagree. |
| 谢利  宝贝  拜托你快出来  | Shelly, baby, please come on out. |
| 不行  | I can't. |
| 快点  我可是你妈咪  | Come on. I'm your mommy. |
| 就当听妈咪话  | Do it for your mommy. |
| 不要  | No. |
| 但我是你亲娘啊  | But I'm your mommy. |
| 你们俩要逗死我了  | Y'all are killing me. |
| "我是你亲娘"  | ‭"I'm your mommy." |
| 我想最悲伤的就是  这事有多悲哀  | I think the saddest part about it is just how sad it is. |
| 我们能帮上什么吗  | Is there anything that we can do? |
| 我也不知道  | I don't know. |
| 或许拥抱会有帮助  | A hug might help. |
| 没问题  | Of course. |
| 你们俩是人吗  | What's wrong with you two? |
| 难道你们不关心我弟弟吗  | Don't you care about my brother? |
| 谢尔顿  | Oh, Sheldon. |
| 够了  我受够你的胡闹了  | That's it. I've had enough of this nonsense. |
| 如果你不出来  我就进去了  | If you don't come out, I'm coming in! |
| 一  二  | One, two, |
| -三  -受到入侵  受到入侵  | - three. - ‭Breach! Breach! |
| -你立马给我过来  -不要  | - You come here right this instant! ‭- No. |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon! ‭ |
| 你不可能永远躲着我  | You can't run away from me forever. |
| 我不用一直躲啊  等你累了就行了  | I don't have to do it forever. Just till you get tired. |
| 玛丽  我赶紧去拿我的摄影机  | Mary, I'm gonna run and go get my video camera. |
| 别在我回来前抓住他  | Don't catch him till I get back. |
| 这可不是玩笑  | This is not a joke! |
| 谢尔顿  给我过来  | Sheldon, get over here! |
| 过来  | Get over here. |
| 谢尔顿·李·库珀  过来  | Sheldon Lee Cooper, get here. |
| 立刻  | Right now. |
| 天啊  我快兴奋得尿出来了  | Oh, Lord, I think I'm gonna wet myself. |
| 过来  给我过来  谢尔顿·李·库珀  | Get! You come here! Sheldon Lee Cooper! |
| 瞧瞧啊  | Look at that. |
| 圣人玛丽居然在喝酒  | St. Mary drinking alcohol. |
| 上帝看到了刚才的事  他能理解  | God saw what just happened. He gets it. |
| 介意我试试抓那个小飞毛腿吗  | Mind if I take a crack at catching the Road Runner? |
| 你有什么我不会的招  | What are you gonna do that I couldn't do? |
| 我以前学会的招  | Oh, a little trick I learned |
| 用来把土拨鼠赶出洞  | trying to get prairie dogs out of the hole. |
| 当然  出来后我们会用球杆敲它们的头  | Of course we'd whack off their heads with a golf club. |
| 但我不会那样对谢尔顿  | I'm not gonna do that to Sheldon. |
| 小饼饼  | Oh, Moon Pie, |
| 我有好东西给你哦  | I've got a little treat for you. |
| 巧克力碎饼干吗  | Chocolate chip? |
| 刚从烤箱里新鲜出炉  | Mm-hmm, right out of the oven. |
| 很好  高温杀菌过  | Good. That means they're sterile. |
| 不如你出来  吃几块吧  | Why don't you come on out here and... have a couple? |
| 我不能那样做  | I can't do that. |
| 那这样吧  | Okay, I tell you what. |
| 我就把饼干放在外面  | I'm gonna just put 'em right out here, |
| 你准备好了就自己出来吃  | and you can come out and get one when you're ready. |
| 这样行不  我就把饼干放在  | How about that? I'm gonna put 'em down |
| 这里  | right... here. |
| 可恶  | Come on! Oh. |
| 听好了  小鬼  | Listen to me, buster. |
| -好的  -你有很多特质  谢尔顿  | - Okay. - ‭You are a lot of things, Sheldon. |
| 你可爱  聪明  讲卫生  | You are cute, smart, hygienic. |
| 但最重要的是  | But most of all... |
| 你  是德州人  | you... are a Texan. |
| 所以呢  | So? |
| 我们德州人  | So Texans |
| 无所畏惧  | aren't afraid of nothin'! |
| 无论是响尾蛇  印第安人  | Rattlesnakes, Indians, |
| 还是墨西哥军队  | the Mexican Army. |
| 你觉得山姆·休斯顿会惧怕小感冒吗  | Do you imagine that Sam Houston was scared of a little old cold? |
| 不会  | No. |
| 吉姆·布伊呢  | Jim Bowie? |
| 不会  | No. |
| 茜茜·斯派塞克呢  | Sissy Spacek? |
| 应该  不会吧  | I... guess not? |
| 你说对了  因为他们都是不折不扣的德州人  | You're damn right, because they're Texans through and through. |
| 现在我要你别再躲在塑料泡泡里  | Now I want you to quit hiding in this plastic bubble, |
| 我要你出来外面  | and I want you to come out here and |
| 像个男人一样吃你的曲奇饼  | eat your cookies out in the world like a man! |
| 像个德州爷们一样  | Like a Texan man! |
| 真厉害  | I'm impressed. |
