| 有时候人们会问我"杰夫牧师  | Sometimes people say to me, "Pastor Jeff, |
| 你怎么知道神是否存在呢"  | how do you know there's a God?" |
| 我说"这是很简单的数学题啊  | And I say, "It's simple math. |
| 神要么存在  要么不存在"  | God either exists or he doesn't." |
| 咱们冷眼来看  | So let's be cynical. |
| 最坏的情况  也是对半开  | Worst-case scenario, there's a 50-50 chance. |
| 而这几率我很满意  | And I like those odds. |
| 这是错的  | That's wrong. |
| 谢利  把你的手放下  | Shelly, put your hand down. |
| 抱歉  您请继续  | Sorry. Please continue. |
| 没事的  玛丽  | It's okay, Mary. |
| 你叫谢尔顿对吗  | I-It's Sheldon, right? |
| -是的  先生  -谢尔顿    | - Yes, sir. - Well, Sheldon, |
| 那请你来台前说说我哪里错了吧  | why don't you come on up here and tell me how I'm wrong. |
| -别  -好的  | - No. - Okay. |
| 大家给他点掌声吧  | Let's give him a hand, everybody. |
| 发生什么事了  | Mm. What's happening? |
| 谢利会把他给撕成渣渣的  | Shelly's gonna eat him alive. |
| 所以...  | So... |
| 你说吧  | you were saying? |
| 你把概率跟可能性搞混了  | You've confused possibilities with probabilities. |
| 根据你的例子  我等会回家  | According to your analogy, when I go home |
| 我可能在床上发现一百万  也可能没有  | I might find a million dollars on my bed or I might not. |
| 但这算个哪门子的对半开  | In what universe is that 50-50? |
| 那你觉得  | So what do you think |
| 神存在的几率有多少呢  | the odds are that God exists? |
| 我觉得是0  | I think they're zero. |
| 我相信科学  | I believe in science. |
| 所以你觉得科学跟宗教不能共处共存  | So you don't think science and religion can go hand in hand? |
| 科学讲事实  宗教讲信仰  | Science is facts, religion is faith. |
| 我喜欢事实  | I prefer facts. |
| 我懂  | I understand that. |
| 那我告诉你几条有趣的事实  | Here's a cool fact for ya. |
| 很多知名科学家都相信神的存在  | A lot of famous scientists believed in God. |
| 艾萨克·牛顿  | Isaac Newton. |
| 阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦  | Albert Einstein. |
| 甚至是查尔斯·达尔文  | Even Charles Darwin. |
| 所以达尔文信神是对的  而进化论是错的吗  | So Darwin's right about God and wrong about evolution? |
| 小子上道了  | Now you're gettin' it. |
| 大家再给谢尔顿一次掌声  | Let's give it up for Sheldon, everybody. |
| 很有风度  | What a good sport. Oh. |
| 但我并没有风度  | But I wasn't a good sport. |
| 在那一刻   我发誓  | At that moment, I vowed to come back |
| 我下周日要回来手撕杰夫牧师  | the following Sunday and destroy Pastor Jeff. |
| 您好  库珀先生  | Uh, hello, Mr. Cooper. |
| 米希在家吗  | Is Missy home? |
| 你好啊  比利  她上教堂了  | Hello, Billy. No, she's at church. |
| 我给她带了我家母鸡下的蛋  | I brought her eggs from my chickens. |
| 我看到了  | I see that. |
| 你可以做水煮蛋或炒蛋  | You can boil them or scramble them. |
| 好的  | Okay. |
| 我喜欢煎蛋  | I like fried. |
| 行  | Okay. |
| 我不喜欢荷包蛋  | I don't like poached. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 打扰了  | Thank you for your time. |
| 好  | Okay. |
| 要我帮你煮了蛋吗  宝贝  | You want me to cook those eggs for you, baby? |
| 不要  那些是礼物  | No. They're a gift. |
| 抱歉  | Sorry. |
| 他还给我写了纸条  | He even wrote me a note. |
| "来自你的秘密仰慕者  比利"  | "Eggs from your secret admirer. Billy." |
| 玛丽  你能进来一下吗  | Mary, can you come in here? |
| 我在做饭  | I'm cookin'. |
| 我真的需要你进来一下  | I really need you to come in here. |
| 到底要干嘛  | What on earth? |
| 怎么了  | What? |
| 你听  | Listen to this. |
| "法国哲学家  | "French philosopher, |
| 数学家与物理学家布莱兹·帕斯卡  | mathematician and physicist, Blaise Pascal, |
| 表示理性的人应该相信神的存在  | argued a rational person should believe God exists |
| 因为如果你对了你就赚到了  | because you have everything to gain if you're right, |
| 而如果你错了  你也不亏"  | and nothing to lose if you're wrong." |
| 感觉没错啊  | Sounds right. |
| 姥姥马上就过来照顾你们  我得走了  | Meemaw is coming over to watch you-- I gotta go. |

| 太多问题了吧  | Enough questions. |
| 他是个胸口疼的中年胖子  | He's a fat, middle-aged man with chest pains. |
| 做点什么啊  | Do something! |
| 抱歉说你胖  亲爱的  | Sorry about the fat, honey. |
| 你自己说你喜欢我这样  | You said you liked me this way. |
| 爸爸会没事的吧  | Is Daddy gonna be okay? |
| 没事的  你们姥爷以前  | Oh, yeah. Your Pop-Pop used to have |
| 也整天胸口有点疼  | little chest pains all the time. |
| 他不是死于心脏病了吗  | Didn't he die of a heart attack? |
| 为了保险理赔  是这原因  | Well, for insurance purposes, yes. |
| 怎么了  | Hey. What's goin' on? |
| 爸爸进医院了  | Dad's in the hospital. |
| 什么  为什么爸爸进医院了  | What? Why's Dad in the hospital? |
| -他会没事的  -他胸口疼  | - He's gonna be fine. - He had chest pains. |
| 他会没事的  | He's gonna be fine. |
| 那我们还在这里干嘛  为什么不去医院  | What are we doin'? Why aren't we going to the hospital? |
| 大家哪里都不许去  | Nobody's goin' nowhere. |
| 我们只需要保持冷静  | We're just gonna stay calm, |
| 好好吃顿晚饭  等你们妈妈打来  | have a nice dinner, and wait for your mama to call |

| 我还想去拉斯维加斯看威利·纳尔逊呢  | Well, I want to go to Las Vegas and see Willie Nelson, |

| 是的  | Yes. |
| 希望你不是在诈我们  | I hope you're not bluffing. |
| 你睡着了吗  | You asleep? |

| 我也没有  | Me neither. |
| 每次电话铃一响  我就好害怕  | Every time the phone rings, I get scared. |
| 我也是  | Me, too. |
| 我要去看爸爸  你们来吗  | I'm goin' to see Dad. You guys want to come? |
| 怎么去  姥姥说我们得待在家里  | How? Meemaw said we have to stay here. |
| 你到底要不要去  | You want to go or not? |
| 嘘  | Shh. |
| 嘘  | Shh. |
| 那我叫谁嘘  | Who do I shush? |
| -嘘  -嘘  | - Shh! - Shh! |

| 我要去  | I'm comin'. |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon? |
| 你才14岁  | You're 14. |
| 你根本不会开车  | You don't know how to drive. |
| 我在4H营开过拖拉机  | I drove a tractor at 4-H camp. |
| 就是一回事  | It's the same thing. |
| 但你当时是坐在农民腿上开的  | But you sat on the farmer's lap. |
| 那你就待在这儿  | Then stay here. |
| 走吧  米希  | Come on, Missy. |
| 你在干什么  | What are you doin'? |
| 路上听听音乐  | Travelin' music. |
| 我跟你们一起去  | I'm coming with you. |
| 你为什么戴着我的头盔  | Why are you wearin' my helmet? |
| 我觉得你开车不会有好结果  | I don't expect this to end well. |
| 还带枕头了  | And the pillows? |
| 同样原因  | Same answer. |
| 关掉  我要专心开车  | Turn it off. I've got to concentrate. |
| 好了  | Okay, |
| 所有人系上安全带  | seat belts, everybody. |
| 拜托你慢慢地开  | Please drive slowly. |
| 淡定  我心里有数  | Relax. I know what I'm doin'. |
| 常常有人问我  | I've often been asked |
| 为什么不愿意学开车  | why I never learned to drive a car. |
| 这一晚  | This night... |
| 就是你的答案  | is your answer. |
| 拜托开慢一点  | Please slow down. |

| 孩子们怎么样  | How are the kids? |
| 他们有点担心  | Oh. They were a little worried, |
| 但我安抚了他们  | but I handled it. |
| 他们睡了吗  | They sleepin'? |
| 睡了  | Yeah, yeah. |
| 当然睡了  | You bet. |
| 再次谢谢你帮忙  | Thanks again for helpin'. |

| 要了个亲命  | Son of a bitch. |
| 我恨死这些死孩子  | I hate those kids. |
| 承认吧  我们迷路了  | Just admit it, we're lost. |
| 我们才没有迷路  | We're not lost. |
| 反正我没见到哪儿有医院  | Well, I sure don't see a hospital anywhere. |
| 我们为什么不找人问问路呢  | Why don't we ask somebody for directions? |
| 因为我们是一群开车的小孩  你个天才  | Because we're children in a car, genius. |
| 我靠  | Dang it! |
| 你是故意瞄准了要撞的吗  | Are you aiming for them? |
| 所有人闭嘴  我能行  | Everybody just shut up. I got this. |
| 完了  我们要蹲号子了  | Oh, no. We're going to jail. |
| 小乔治才要去蹲号子  | Georgie's going to jail. |
| 我要说我是被绑架的  | I'm saying I was kidnapped. |
| 这主意不错  | That's a good plan. |
| 你和我都是被绑架的人质  | You and I were kidnapped. |
| 如果我要去蹲号子  你们也跑不了  | If I'm going to jail, we're all going to jail. |

| 那是救护车  要开去医院的啊  | It's an ambulance-- it's going to the hospital. |
| 坐好了  | Hang on. |
| 我小小声地放音乐行不  | How about I put the radio on real low? |
| 闭嘴  | Shut up. |
| 玛丽  | Mary. |
| -妈妈  -他们在哪  | - Mom! - Where are they? |
| 你说谁  | Where's who? |
| 更重要的是  | More importantly... |
| -乔治怎么样了  -妈妈  | - ...how is George? - Mom! |
| 他们在这儿呢  | Ah. There they are! |
| 我刚在大厅跟几个小淘气走丢了  | Ha! I lost the little rascals in the... hall. |
| 我想见爸爸  | I want to see Dad. |
| -我也是  -我也是  | - Me, too. - Me, too. |
| 他现在和医生在一起  | The doctors are with him now. |
| 等会我带你们进去  | I'll take you in a bit. |
| 他们怎么会来这儿  | Why are they here? |
| 这不是明摆着的吗  | I think it's obvious. |
| 他们好爱爸爸  | They love their daddy. |
| 我知道  但他们怎么没在家睡觉  | No, I get that. Why aren't they home in bed? |
| 大家都睡不着  | Well, nobody could sleep. |
| 我觉得这样做才对  | I thought it was the right thing. |
| 诈得漂亮  | Good bluff. |
| 嘘  | Shh. |
| 好的  谢谢  | Okay, thank you. |
| 你们需要什么吗  饿不饿  | You all need anything? You hungry? |
| -不饿  -不用了  谢谢  | - No. - No, thank you. |
| 大家在这儿坐着  | Okay, everybody sit tight. |
| 我去看看你们爸爸  | I'm gonna go check on your dad. |
| 小乔治  | Georgie. |
| 把我的车钥匙还给我  | Give me my damn keys. |
| 嗯  给你  | Oh, yeah. Here. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 我怎么比你们还早到医院  | How did I beat you here? |
| 我们一直撞到垃圾桶  | We kept hitting garbage cans. |
| 要命了  | Oh, God. |
| 我要去洗手  | I need to wash my hands. |
| -这里有些细菌能杀死人  -等等  | - There are germs here that can kill you. - Hold up. |
| 你们都喜欢外婆来照顾你们  对吧  | Now, y'all like it when your meemaw babysits. |
| 可以玩扑克  吃糖  放鞭炮  | Poker, candy, firecrackers. |
| 没错  | Yes. |
| -嗯  -是的  | - Yeah. - Yeah. |
| 如果你们母亲发现了  | Well, if your mother ever finds out |
| 你今晚做的事  | what you did tonight, |
| 那以后都没有那种好日子了  | that is never gonna happen again. |
| 我不能对我妈妈说谎  | I can't lie to my mother. |
| 你当然可以  相信自己  | Sure you can. Believe in yourself! |
| 虽然看起来是那样  | Despite what it looks like, |
| 但我那晚没向上帝祈祷  | I didn't pray to God that night. |
| 而是向布莱兹·帕斯卡祈祷  | I prayed to Blaise Pascal. |
| 我的想法是  | My thinking was, |
| 如果他对关于上帝存在的理论是对的  | if he was right about the existence of God, |
| 那他可以帮我转达  | then he could pass along my request |
| 让我爸爸好起来的请求  | for my dad to get better. |
| 如果他错了  | If he was wrong... |
| 这个嘛  | well... |
| 在这一刻  我需要他是对的  | in this moment, I needed him to be right. |
| 怎么去了那么久  | What's taking so long? |
| 嘘  | Shh. |
| 小声点  偷车贼  | Keep your voice down, car thief. |
| 我才没有偷你的车  只是借用  | I didn't steal your car, I just borrowed it. |
| 总有一天你会需要有人去保释你  | You're gonna need to make bail someday. |
| 到时千万别来找我  | Do not come to me. |
| 好消息  你们的爸爸不会有事  | Good news! Your daddy's gonna be fine. |
| 应该过两天就能回家了  | Should be home in a day or two. |
| 是心脏病发作吗  | And was it a heart attack? |
| 轻微的  没有造成永久性损伤  | Minor. No permanent damage. |
| 真是太好了  | Oh! That's wonderful! |
| 我们的祈祷应验了  | Our prayers have been answered. |
| 孩子们  快来  | Come on, everybody, |
| 我们去和爸爸打招呼  | let's say hello to your old dad. |
| 走吧  | Come on. |
| 有短暂的一瞬间  | For a brief moment, |
| 我内心充满了信仰的治愈能量  | I was filled with the healing power of faith. |
| 但第二天  我们全家都病倒了  | Then the next day, we all got violently ill |
| 因为吃了比利的鸡蛋  我的信仰也散了  | from Billy Sparks' eggs, and I was over it. |
| 今早我想谈谈一切是如何开始的  | I thought I'd talk this morning about how it all began. |
| 大家都知道创世的第一天  | Now, everybody knows how, on the first day of creation, |
| 神说  "要有光"  | God said, "Let there be light." |
| 便有了光  | And there was light. |
| 当神见到光  就知道是好事  | And when God saw that light, he knew it was good. |
| 又来了  | Oh, here we go. |
| 什么事  谢尔顿  | Yes, Sheldon. |
| 你说祂第四天才造了太阳  | You said he didn't create the sun until day four. |
| 是的  | Yeah. |
| 那前三天哪来的光呢  | So how could there be light the first three days? |
| 神就是光  | God is light. |
| 那么说神是光子  | So God's a photon? |
| 是神让光子有存在的可能  | God's what made photons possible. |
| 那祂是第几天造出光子的  | And what day did he do that? |
| 我想是第一天  | I would think day one. |
| 如果我抱胸跪倒假装病发  也许能逃离这里  | If I grab my chest and keel over, maybe we can get out of here. |
| 你这话也太不合适了  | That's a terrible thing to say. |
| 因为第一天才刚开始  | ...because the first day had just begun. |
| 那就是在宇宙大爆炸之前吗  | So, before the Big Bang? |
| 没有宇宙大爆炸  | There was no Big Bang. |
| 只有"道"[一个字]  | There was only the Word. |
