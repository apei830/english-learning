| 别这样  你不能怪自己  | Oh, come on. You can't blame yourself. |
| 这持续不了多久  还记得有一次蜜蜂飞进屋里  | This isn't gonna last. Remember the time a bee got in the house |
| 他有几个月睡觉都盖着张网吗  | and he slept under a net for a couple months? |
| 这次不一样  | This is different. |
| -怎么个不一样  -  | - How? - First of all, |
| 那蜜蜂是你放进来的  | you let that bee in. |
| 是你的错  | The bee was your fault. |
| -好吧  -其次  | - Okay. - Secondly, |
| 这次关系到他的健康  | this is about his health. |
| 他是个脆弱的小男孩  | He is a fragile little boy. |
| 他不能这样下去  | He can't go on like this. |
| 我不是在跟你吵  | I'm not arguing with you. |
| 只是...  我们就再给他点时间吧  | Let's just, you know, give him a little more time. |

| 他在喝什么  | What's he drinking? |
| 猪排和肉汁  | Pork chop and gravy. |

| 我们吃了美味的晚餐  散了步  | We had a nice dinner, took a walk. |
| 他离过婚的  你知道吗  | He's a divorcee, you know. |
| 我不知道  | I didn't. |

| 你搅拌前还把面包皮去掉啊  | You're actually cutting the crust off before you blend it? |
| 我昨天做金枪鱼三明治时没切  他说喝得出来  | I left it on his tuna sandwich yesterday, he said he could tell. |
| 只喝了一半  | Only drank half of it. |
| 玛丽  你觉得这次闹得够久了吗  | Mary, you think this has gone on long enough? |
| 又不麻烦  | No trouble. |
| 不过要是有多一台搅拌机就更好了  | But it'd be better if I had two blenders. |
| 你别再惯着他就更好了  | Be better if you stopped coddling him. |
| 我不知道还能怎么办  | Well, I don't know what else to do. |
| 我提议过带他去看专家  | I suggested that we take him to some kind of professional, |
| 但你说他长大就不会这样了  | but you said he'd outgrow it. |
| 如果你想找心理医生  | Well, if you're looking for a psychiatrist, |
| 我敢说我的新男友有亲戚做这行  | I bet my new fella's related to one. |
| 你觉得呢  | What do you think? |
| 说不好  | Not sure. |
| 如果我们带他去看心理医生  | If we take him to a shrink, |
| 感觉我们就承认了他有问题  | it feels like we're admitting something's wrong with him. |
| 他有五个礼拜没吃过固体食物了  | He hasn't had solid food in five weeks. |
| 如果他真有毛病  | Well, if there is something wrong with him, |
| 也肯定不会是便秘  | it ain't constipation. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 看能不能找个医生  | Let's see if we can find somebody. |
| 谢谢你  | Thank you. |
| 还得再加点奇多  | Needs a few more Cheetos. |
| 我妈成功找到了一位我们负担得起的  | My mother managed to locate a family psychiatrist |
| 家庭心理医生  | within our price range. |

| 这个人是不是会逼我吃固体食物  | Is this man gonna make me eat solid foods? |
| 不会  他只是想和你谈谈  | No, he just wants to talk to you about it. |
| 你有没告诉他  我的人生有很多大事要完成  | Did you tell him I have a lot to accomplish in my life |
| 决不能被没嚼烂的香肠噎死  | and cannot afford to be killed by an unchewed sausage? |
| 说了  但用了别种说法  | Not in those exact words. |

| 拥有超能力的年少变种人  | Young mutants with incredible powers |
| 被世人恐惧和误解  | who were feared and misunderstood by the entire world. |

| 谢利是个非常聪明的孩子  | Shelly is incredibly bright. |
| 他的智商堪比爱因斯坦  | I mean, his IQ is right up there with Albert Einstein |
| 和英国那个坐轮椅的人[霍金]  | and that English wheelchair fella. |
| -好的  -他是一个9岁的高中生  | - Cool. - He's nine years old and he's in high school, |
| 所以你不能把他当寻常孩子看待  | so you can't judge him like other kids. |
| -明白了  -乔治  | - I hear ya. - George, |
| 告诉他  谢利总是滔滔不绝  | tell him about how he's always going on and on |
| 说什么亚原子粒子的  | about subatomic particles and such. |
| 他能说个没完没了  | Oh, he'll get to gabbin' about it. |
| 我们已经习惯了他有各种怪癖和奇思妙想  | We're accustomed to his quirks and oddities. |
| 但"害怕固体食物"这件事  | But this whole "being afraid of solid foods" thing, |
| 真的让我们懵了  | it's got us thrown. |
| 容我先说一句  | Okay. Let me just start by saying |
| 你们来对了地方  | you came to the right place. |
| 谢尔顿和我碰巧有很多共同之处  | Sheldon and I happen to have a lot in common. |
| 我小时候也是个特别的男孩  | I, too, was a special little boy. |
| 四年级时  我就能读懂七年级的书  | In the fourth grade, I was reading at a seventh grade level. |
| 我都不用告诉你们  七年级时我到什么程度了  | And I don't have to tell you where I was by the seventh grade. |

| 我去坐一下豆袋椅  | I'm gonna give the beanbag a whirl. |

| 阿尔法法  斯代米  巴克威特  | Alfalfa, Stymie, Buckwheat. |
| 狗狗皮蒂也死了吗  | Even Petey the dog? |
| 特别是狗狗皮蒂  | Oh, especially Petey the dog. |

| 你们想去吃冰淇淋吗  | Y'all want to go get some ice cream? |
| 那晚饭怎么办  | What about dinner? |
| 管它呢  走吧  | What about it? Come on. |
| 阿尔夫也死了吗  | Is ALF dead? |
| 还没  不过也快了  | No, but it's just a matter of time. |
| 你不会相信有多少孩子有食物恐惧症  | You'd be surprised how many children have food phobias. |
| -是吗  -是的  我像谢尔顿那么大时  | - Is that so? - Oh, yeah. When I was Sheldon's age, |
| -很怕布丁上那层奇怪的皮  -真的吗  | - I was afraid of that weird skin on top of puddin'. - Really? |
| 我也是  你知道吗  要是覆上一层莎伦牌保鲜膜  | Me, too. You know, you put a little Saran Wrap on... |
| 乔治  | George. |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon? |
| 他跑哪儿去了  | Where the hell did he go? |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon? |
| 应该走不远  | Couldn't have gone far. |
| 为什么  | Why not? |
| 好极了  好极了  | Right on, right on. |
| 洗手间和楼梯间我都找遍了  | I checked the bathroom, the stairs. |
| 他不在这栋大楼里  | He's not in the building. |
| 我很担心  家里没人接电话  | I'm worried. No one's answering at home. |
| 保持冷静  我们会找到他的  | Stay calm. We'll find him. |
| 我小的时候...  | You know, when I was a kid... |
| 闭嘴  | Shut up. |
| 好吧  | Well... |
| 我不常独自在都市丛林转悠  | It wasn't typical for me to wander out into |

| 我第一次尝到了超级英雄连载漫画的滋味  | I had gotten my first taste of serialized superheroes, |
| 我需要更多  | and I needed more. |
| 打扰了  你有《X战警》第137期吗  | Excuse me, do you have X-Men #137? |
| 我想知道接下来的故事  谢了  | I'd like to know what happens next, please. |
| 角落后面那个箱子  | Back bin in the corner. |
| 你怎么来这儿了  | What are you doing here? |
| 你好  丹  | Oh, hello, Tam. |
| 你不是说漫画是给小孩子看的吗  | I thought you said comic books are for children. |
| 我是一个复杂的年轻人  | I'm a complicated young man. |
| 我觉得我们应该报警  | I think we should call the police. |
| 不需要出动警察  我们能找到他  | We don't need the police. We'll find him. |
| 这都是我的错  | This is all my fault. |
| 他跑走都是因为我们带他去看心理医生  | He ran away because we took him to a therapist. |
| 那15块美金的诊费我们是要不回来了  | That's 15 dollars we ain't getting back. |
| 你担心的居然是这个吗  | That's what you're worried about? |
| 不  当然不是  | No. Course not. |
| 谢尔顿不会有事的  | And Sheldon's fine. |
| 你也知道他的个性  | You know what he's like. |
| 要是真有人把他带走了  | If someone took him, |
| 肯定也很快受不了  把他送回来  | I'm sure they'll bring him right back. |
| 我看得很开心  但我对里面的拟声词有意见  | I'm enjoying this, but I'm having trouble with the onomatopoeia. |
| 拟什么  | The what? |
| 拟声词  | The onomatopoeia. |
| 模拟声音的词  | Words that imitate sounds. |
| "卡咚"  "口胡"  | KaThoom. SNikt. |
| "砰当"  | BAmf. |
| 作家不应该自己乱造词  | Writers shouldn't make up words. |
| "拟声词"就是某人乱造出来的词  | Somebody made up "onomatopoeia". |
| 你挑战我  我喜欢  | You challenge me. I like that. |
| 姥姥  你还会再生小孩吗  | Meemaw, are you gonna have more babies? |
| 苍天啊  我才不要  | Good Lord, no! |
| 她太老了  生不出来了  | She's too old to have any more babies. |
| 不用生啊  等你活得够老  | Don't have to have 'em. You live long enough, |
| 头发和牙齿就开始脱落  | your hair and your teeth start falling out, |
| 你开始尿床  自己就变成宝宝了  | you start wetting the bed, you get to be one. |
| 真逗  | That's funny. |
| 我们以后要给你穿尿布了  | We're gonna have to put a diaper on you. |
| 等你帮我穿的时候就笑不出来了  | You won't be laughing when you're doing it. |
| 但我可能会笑  | I might be. |
| 姥姥  除了谢尔顿  我和小乔治谁更聪明  | Hey, Meemaw, next to Sheldon, who's smarter, me or Georgie? |
| -当然是我啦  -为什么  | - Me, of course. - Why you? |
| 我的脑袋比较大  | My head's bigger. |
| 跟头大头小没关系  | It doesn't matter. |
| 今晚的重点不是谢尔顿  | Tonight is not about Sheldon. |
| 是啊  平常什么事重点都在谢尔顿身上  | Yeah, right. Everything's always about Sheldon. |
| 对啊  大多数时候  | Yeah. Most of the time, |
| 我们就好像不存在一样  | it's like we don't even exist. |
| 谢尔顿的确是得到了大部分的关注  | I guess Sheldon does get most of the attention. |
| 但或许这是好事啊  | Maybe that's a good thing. |
| 哪里好了  | How? |
| 如果不是有他  | Well, if it weren't for him, |
| 你们爸妈就肯定会严格管着你们俩  | your parents would be on your ass all the time. |
| 也是  我好像从来没从这角度想过  | Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way before. |
| 拜托  要不是有他  | You kidding me? Right now, |
| 你们爸妈现在一定在唠叨让你们打扫房间  | they would be nagging you about cleaning your room |
| 催你们去做作业  | and doing your homework. |
| 可现在你们能坐在停车场里  | Instead, you're sitting in a parking lot, |
| 吃着冰激凌当晚餐  | eating a Blizzard for dinner. |
| -还加了曲奇面团  -对啊  | - With cookie dough in it. - Exactly. |
| 而谢尔顿却被困在无聊的心理医生办公室  | While Sheldon is stuck sitting in some boring shrink's office. |
| 妈说他们是带他去剪头发  | Mom told me they were taking him for a haircut. |
| 对哦  | Oh. Yeah. |
| 是啦  | Right. |
| 那等他回家了  记得夸他头发剪得不错  | Well, when he gets home, say his hair looks good. |
| 怎么了  | What? |
| 没事  | Nothing. |
| 想来一根吗  | You want one? |
| 不用了  | No. |
| 那个...  | Well... |
| 如果你想吃了  你就自己拿  | if you change your mind, help yourself. |
| 我不用读太多漫画书  | I didn't have to read many comic books |
| 就知道每个英雄都有弱点  | to understand that every superhero had a weakness, |
| 那些弱点需要他们靠着  | something they had to overcome |
| 无与伦比的勇气来克服  | through an extraordinary act of courage. |
| 对镭射眼来说是失去琴·葛雷  | For Cyclops, it was the loss of Jean Grey. |
| 对小淘气来说  则是与人类触碰  | For Rogue, it was human touch. |
| 对我来说  是需要咀嚼的食物  | For me, it was food that required chewing. |
| 所以如果我真的也是变种人  就得克服难关  | So if I truly was a mutant, I would have to do the same. |
| 在这一天  我不能被打败  | On this day, I would not be defeated. |
| 因为这一天是我变成  | Because this was the day I became... |
| 咀嚼侠的日子  | ...The Chewer. |
| 就这样  我克服了我对被噎到的恐惧  | Just like that, I overcame my fear of choking. |
| 唯一剩下的就只有怕狗  | All that was left was my fear of dogs, |
| 鸟  昆虫  细菌  | birds, insects, germs, |
| 拥抱  纽扣裤裆裤  | hugging, button fly pants, |
| 河  池塘  湖  海洋  | rivers, ponds, lakes, oceans, |
