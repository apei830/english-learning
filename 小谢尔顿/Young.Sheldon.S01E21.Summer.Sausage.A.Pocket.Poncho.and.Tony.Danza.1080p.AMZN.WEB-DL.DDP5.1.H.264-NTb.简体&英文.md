| 《少年谢尔顿》前情提要  | Previously, on Young Sheldon... |
| 我跟约翰·斯特吉斯博士一直有通信  | I've been corresponding with Dr. John Sturgis |
| 他在东德克萨斯理工大学教书  | at East Texas Tech. |
| 他说我能去旁听他的课  | He said I could audit his course. |
| 康妮  我很希望能再跟你见面  | Connie, I would like to see you again. |
| 或许有机会我们可以一起吃个晚饭  | Perhaps we could have dinner sometime. |
| 太好了  我们很愿意  | Yes, we would love that. |
| 我们会愿意吗  | We would? |
| 如果他们结婚了  我们家族的聪明人数量  | If they get married, we immediately double |
| 就可以瞬间加倍呢  | the number of smart people in our family. |
| 你好  斯特吉斯博士  | Hello, Dr. Sturgis. |
| 你好  谢尔顿  | Hello, Sheldon. |
| 你能想象你住在这里吗  我就能  | Can you see yourself living here? I can. |
| 热狗丁跟意面的比例完美  | Mmm. Good ratio of hot dog chunks to spaghetti. |
| 我一直在实验完美比例  很高兴你注意到了  | I've been experimenting. Glad you noticed. |
| 孩子们  洗手吃饭啦  | Kids! Wash up for dinner! |
| 会是谁来按门铃啊  | Now, who on earth is that? |
| 不许你把热狗丁全挑出来吃了  | And don't be picking out all the chunks. |
| 抱歉我迟到了  | Sorry I'm a little late. |
| 我的裤腿卡自行车链条里了  | My pant leg got stuck in the chain. |
| 你是谁  | Who are you? |
| 我是约翰·斯特吉斯  | I'm John Sturgis. |
| 谢尔顿邀请我来共进晚餐  | Sheldon invited me to dinner. |
| 好的  您先请进吧  | Okay. Um, come in, I guess. |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon? |
| 来了  | Coming! |
| 这是给你的  | This is for you. |
| 是起司与熏香肠  | It's cheese and summer sausages. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 熏香肠就代表这不需要放冰箱冷藏  | Summer sausage means it doesn't need to be refrigerated. |
| 是这样吗  | Is that so? |
| 是的  | It is. |
| 好的  谢尔顿  | Okay. Sheldon? |
| 斯特吉斯博士  欢迎你来  | Dr. Sturgis, welcome. |
| 谢谢  谢尔顿  | Thank you, Sheldon. |
| 谢尔顿  你不觉得你应该先让我知道  | Sheldon, you think you might've let me know |
| 你邀请了人来共进晚餐吗  | you invited company over for dinner? |
| 我想过告诉你  但我怕你会拒绝  | I did think about it, but I was afraid you might say no. |
| 来看看我的火车模型吧  | Come see my train set. |
| 好  | All right! |
| ♪ 世上没人比我强壮 ♪  | ♪ Nobody else is stronger than I am ♪ |
| ♪ 昨天我移了一座山 ♪  | ♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪ |
| ♪ 我相信我能当你的英雄 ♪  | ♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪ |
| ♪ 我是个了不起的小家伙 ♪  | ♪ I am a mighty little man ♪ |
| ♪ 我是个了不起的小家伙 ♪  | ♪ I am a mighty little man ♪ |
| 少  | 年 |
| 我的老天啊  | Good Lord. |
| 你是说他就这么突然出现在你家吗  | You mean he just showed up out of nowhere? |
| 他现在在车库里跟谢尔顿玩火车呢  | Yep. He's out in the garage playing trains with Sheldon. |
| 你的头发为什么是湿的  | Why's your hair wet? |
| 如果你真想知道  我本来是在做水中有氧  | If you must know, I was doing my water aerobics |
| 然后我的泳帽掉了  | and my swimming cap fell off. |
| 这位斯特吉斯兄台没先跟你说过吗  | This Sturgis fella didn't say a word to you? |
| 要是有  你觉得我还会去基督教青年会里的  | If he did, do you think I would have been doing frog kicks |
| 游泳池中蛙式蹬腿吗  | at the YMCA? |
| 你看起来很棒  | You look great. |
| 32毫米模型铁道规轨距的火车最棒了  | O gauge trains are definitely the best. |
| 是的  没错  | Oh, yes, they are. |
| 真是个意外之喜啊  | Oh, well, what a pleasant surprise. |
| 太好了  你也来啦  | Oh, good. You're here, too. |
| 是啊  | I am. |
| 你们都准备好吃晚饭了吗  | Are y'all about ready for dinner? |
| 我好了  | I am. |
| 那我们快去吧  | Well, then, let's go. |
| 姥姥  你闻起来有氯的味道  | Meemaw, you smell like chlorine. |
| 你说出来干嘛  | Why say it? |
| 你说的是真的  | You weren't kidding. |
| 意面配热狗丁真是超好吃  | Spaghetti and hot dogs is delightful. |
| 我妈找出完美比例后又更棒了  | Even better since Mom perfected the chunk ratio. |
| 斯特吉斯博士  谢尔顿跟我们说  | So, Dr. Sturgis, Sheldon tells us |
| 你在大学里是客座教授  | you're a guest professor at the university. |
| 是的  | I am. ‭Hmm. |
| 这表示你只是暂时待在这个城市吗  | Does that mean that you're only here temporarily? |
| 目前的计划是这样  | Well, that's the plan for now. |
| 但如果有理由留下  我也可以  | But I could be enticed to stay. |
| 姥姥  我觉得他话中有话  | Meemaw, I do believe there was subtext there. |
| 你有听出弦外之音吗  | Did you pick up on it? |
| 有的  | Yeah. |
| 我说你话中有话没理解错吧  | Was I correct to infer there was subtext there? |
| 理解很正确  | You were. |
| 好的  那一切没事  | Okay, we're all good. |
| 真不敢相信他们让我来小孩桌吃饭  | I can't believe they're making me sit and eat at the kiddie table. |
| 这里比较好  | It's better here. |
| 好在哪  | How? |
| 不用饭前祷告  不用被逼吃蔬菜  | We don't have to pray, eat our vegetables |
| 而且可以骂脏话  | and we can curse. |
| 或许你说的有道理吧  | Hmm. Maybe you're right. |
| 当然有啊  你个傻逼  | Course I am, you ass-face. |
| 斯特吉斯博士  你觉得人类会有把重力  | Dr. Sturgis, do you think we're ever going to unify gravity |
| 跟其他三种基本力统一的一天吗  | with the other three fundamental forces? |
| 我的冰箱上面有个便利贴  | I have a sticky note on my refrigerator |
| 天天提醒我要做到这件事  | which reminds me every day to do just that. |
| 你是什么时候开始把研究重心  | When did you decide to focus your research |
| -放在量子...  -谢尔顿  我觉得  | - on quantum... ‭- Um, Sheldon, I think |
| 你有点霸占人家聊天的机会了  | you're kind of dominating the conversation. |
| 你何不让姥姥跟斯特吉斯博士聊聊呢  | Why don't you let your meemaw talk to Dr. Sturgis. |
| 抱歉  你们聊吧  | Oh, I'm sorry. By all means. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| -康妮  -怎么了  约翰  | - Connie? ‭- Yes, John. |
| 你是故意让自己有氯的味道的吗  | Do you smell like chlorine on purpose? |
| 你确定不用我送你回家吗  | You sure I can't give you a ride home? |
| 你的自行车可以放到我小卡车后面一起啊  | I can throw your bike in the back of my pickup truck. |
| 谢谢好意  我挺喜欢夜晚的空气  | Thank you, no. I-I enjoy the night air. |
| 而且热狗与意面富含热量  | Plus, hot dogs and spaghetti is a highly caloric event |
| 需要自己做点有氧运动来消耗掉  | that demands an aerobic effort on my part. |
| 很高兴今晚能有机会跟您共进晚餐  | Well, it was a pleasure spending the evening with you. |
| 有机会欢迎再来  | We should do it again sometime. |
| 那太好了  什么时候呢  | Great. When? |
| 明晚怎么样  | How about tomorrow? |
| 这样吧  我们之后再讨论  | You know what, we'll figure it out. |
| 来  我陪你走到你的自行车吧  | Come on, let me see you to your Schwinn. |
| 再见啦  | Bye. |
| 晚安  | Good night. ‭ |
| 这是我在这个家里吃过  | Well, that was the most stimulating dinner |
| 最振奋人心的一顿晚餐了  | I've ever had in this house. |
| 你开心就好  | Glad you enjoyed it. |
| 那个男人真是我的人生榜样啊  | That man is a true role model. |
| 恭喜你终于找到了一个男性榜样啊  | Well, it's nice you finally got a man you can look up to. |
| 是啊  我深有体会  | Oh, believe me, I know. |
| 你是想全憋在心里  | You gonna keep it all bottled up |
| -还是你想说出来  -什么  | - or you want to talk about it? - ‭What? |
| 我没事啦  | I'm fine. |
| 没什么好聊的  | There's nothing to talk about. |
| -你确定吗  -确定  | - You sure? ‭- Yeah. |
| 好好睡吧  | Sweet dreams. |
| 你知道你自己很想讲  | You know you want to talk about it. |
| 你也看到了  | You saw it. |
| 我的亲生儿子不觉得我能当他的榜样  | My own son can't even imagine me being a role model? |
| 你让我心里怎么舒坦  | How am I supposed to be okay with that? |
| 你是小乔治的人生榜样啊  | You're a role model for Georgie. |
| 曾经是  | I used to be. |
| 他现在只想长大变成像男演员托尼·丹扎  | Now he wants to grow up and be Tony Danza. |
| 你忘了自己还有个女儿  | Did you forget you have a daughter |
| 而她如果有个良好的男性榜样也会受益良多吗  | who would really benefit from having a good man to look up to? |
| 老天爷啊  | Oh, dear Lord. |
| 你还真忘了  | You did forget. ‭ |
| 我没忘  我只是...  | I didn't forget. I just... |
| 我只是不知道怎么跟她相处  | I don't know how to spend time with her. |
| 又不是让你登天  乔治  | It ain't rocket science, George. |
| 她就是个小女孩  | She's a little girl. |
| 问她想做什么  | Ask her what she wants to do |
| 然后陪她一起做  | and then do it with her. |
| 好吧  我应该可以  | Oh, yeah. I suppose. |
| 相信我  你能陪她她会很开心的  | Trust me. She'll be thrilled to spend some time with you. |
| 好啦  | Okay. |
| 我再试试看  | Yeah, I'll give it a try. |
| 等我陪她...  做她想做的事情的时候  | Hey, when we do, you know, whatever it is she likes to do |
| 你也会在一旁陪着吧  | you're gonna be there, right? |
| 不会啊  | No. |
| 好吧  这事瞬间难了  | Well, this just got harder. |
| 姥姥  | Meemaw? |
| 姥姥  | Meemaw! |
| 什么事  | What? |
| 我专门去研究了  | I've been researching things |
| 我们可以跟斯特吉斯博士一起做的事  | that you and I can do with Dr. Sturgis. |
| 今晚在莱斯大学有一堂课  | There's a lecture tonight at Rice University called |
| "我们银河的中心在发生什么事"  | "What's happening at the center of our galaxy." |
| 你先停一下  | Let me just stop you right there. |
| 别放心  我知道银河中心的情况  | Don't worry. I know what's happening at the center |
| 但我不会剧透你的  | but I would never spoil it for you. |
| 听我说  我知道你十分希望  | Look, I know you're invested |
| 我跟约翰能有感情发展  | in me and John having a relationship |
| 我的意思也不是我们不会  | and I'm not saying we won't. |
| 但如果你整天碍事  我们就很难有发展  | But it ain't gonna happen with you always underfoot. |
| 我碍手碍脚了吗  | Have I been underfoot? |
| 亲爱的  大人们想要多了解彼此  | Honey, in order for grown-ups to get to know each other |
| 就需要有单独相处的时间  | they need to have some alone time. |
| 如果我发誓保持缄默  能让我在一旁待着吗  | What if I'm around, but I took a vow of silence? |
| 回家吃你的早饭去  | Go home and have your breakfast. |
| 她说大人们想多了解彼此  | And then she said for grown-ups to get to know each other |
| 就需要有单独相处的时间  | they have to have time alone. |
| 很有道理  还有呢  | Makes sense. What else? |
| 貌似我当个碍事精对浪漫有害  | Apparently my being underfoot isn't conducive to romance. |
| 你的消息很有用  | This is very helpful. |
| 谢谢你  | Thank you. |
| 乐意为你效劳  | I'm at your service. |
| 塞莱斯特  你为什么总爱上坏男人  | Oh, Celeste, why do you always fall for bad boys? |
| 爸爸你来啦  | Hi, Dad. |
| 你在干嘛呢  | What you doing? |
| 我做错事了吗   | Am I in trouble? |
| 没有没有  我就来关心你一下  | No, no. Just-just checking in on you. |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 因为你是我女儿  而且我爱你啊  | 'Cause you're my daughter and I love you. |
| 越说越尴尬了  | This is getting weird. |
| 是啊  我是在想...  | It is. I was just thinking that, uh |
| 你跟我呢...  不太常一起相处  | you and me, you know, we don't spend much time together. |
| 我们应该找点事一起做  | You know, we should find something to do |
| 就我跟你  | just-just two of us. |
| -比如什么  -你说啊  | - Like what? - ‭You tell me. |
| 你觉得什么有趣  | What-what sounds fun? |
| 我想你请我出去吃晚餐  | I'd like to be taken to dinner. |
| 很好  上哪吃  | Great. Where? |
| 去德州最时髦高档的餐厅  | To the fanciest restaurant in all of Texas. |
| 是...  | Which is...? |
| 红龙虾餐厅  海陆大总汇  | Red Lobster, where the surf meets the turf. |
| 一言为定  | You got it. |
| 谢谢老爸  | Thanks, Dad. |
| 妈  你得带我出去购物  | Mom, you got to take me shopping! |
| 我要买条新裙子  | I need a dress! |
| 是谁  | Yeah? |
| 康妮  是我约翰·斯特吉斯  | Connie, this is John Sturgis. |
| 你好啊  约翰·斯特吉斯  | Well, hello, John Sturgis. |
| 你好吗  | How are you? |
| 我今早吃桃子被桃核崩了牙  | I chipped a tooth on a peach pit this morning |
| 除此之外一切都好  | but otherwise, I'm okay. |
| 很好  你好就好  | Good. Good to hear it. |
| 下一件事情呢  | Next order of business. |
| 我是想邀请你今晚一起吃饭  | I would like to have dinner with you tonight |
| 就我们俩人单独  | just the two of us. |
| 这听起来很不错  | Oh, well, that sounds nice. |
| 你有什么计划  | What'd you have in mind? |
| 我想来你家为你做一顿四川菜  | I'd like to come to your house and cook you a Szechuan feast. |
| 抱歉  你说什么  | I'm sorry, a what? |
| 四川菜  | Szechuan. |
| 一种中式料理风格  | It's a style of Chinese cooking I learned |
| 是我在中国旅游时学会的  | when I was traveling through China. |
| 真棒  我很愿意  | Well, wonderful. I would love that. |
| 太好了  你家有炒菜锅吗  | Great. Do you have a wok? |
| 没有呢  | I do not. |
| 没关系  | Not a problem. |
| 我有便携炒菜锅  | I have a travel wok. |
| 好的  | Okay. |
| 六点怎么样  | Uh, so, uh, what do you say about 6:00? |
| 就这么说定了  | It's a date. |
| 好极了  | Terrific. |
| 对了  我们别告诉谢尔顿  | Oh, and, um, let's not mention this to Sheldon |
| 他就不会来碍事了  | so as to keep him from being underfoot. |
| 你是不是跟他联系过  | Have you been talking to him? |
| 是啊  晚点见  | I have. See you later. |
| 不过是去红龙虾餐厅  我有必要盛装打扮吗  | Do I really need to get dressed up to go to Red Lobster? |
| 你盛装打扮是为了女儿不是为了吃饭  | You're getting dressed up for your daughter. |
| 这是新衬衣  记得要个围兜  | And that's a new shirt, so be sure to ask for a bib. |
| 我准备好了  | I'm ready. |
| 你要穿这样去吃晚餐吗  | You're going to dinner wearing that? |
| 你是想说她看起来真美吧  | I think you mean she looks beautiful. |
| 你看起来真美  | You look beautiful. |
| 谢谢赞美  乔治  | Why thank you, George. |
| 你今晚还是叫我爸爸如何  | How 'bout we stick with "dad" tonight? |
| 行吧  但你要叫我米丽莎  | Okay, but you call me Melissa. |
| 你先请  米丽莎  | After you, Melissa. |
| 谢了  乔治  | Thanks, George. |
| 老天  | Oh, my. |
| 我知道  我看起来好像忍者神龟  | I know, I look like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. |
| 快进来吧  | Well, come on in. |
| 谢尔顿  进厨房吃饭吧  | Sheldon, come in the kitchen for dinner. |
| -我能在这里吃吗  -为什么  | - Can I eat out here? - Why? |
| 斯特吉斯教授在跟姥姥进行晚餐约会  | Dr. Sturgis is having a dinner date with Meemaw. |
| 我不想错过  | I don't want to miss it. |
| 好吧  | Fine. |
| 在那段时间里  我看到三辆车经过  | During that time, I saw three cars drive by |
| 还看到一只浣熊拖走一片比萨  | and a raccoon dragging a slice of pizza. |
| 两位  谢谢  | Uh, table for two. |
| 没问题  | No problem. |
| 容我帮您  | Allow me. |
| 准了  | You are allowed. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 是的  谢谢  | Yes, thank you. |
| 恕我冒昧  | If I may. |
| 你觉得怎么样  | So what do you think? |
| 我觉得我们穿得太寒酸了  | I think we might be underdressed. |
| 一顿成功的四川晚餐的秘诀  | The trick to a successful Szechuan dinner |
| 就是四川花椒  | is the Szechuan pepper. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 你可能会发现  | Now, you may notice |
| 你的嘴唇和舌头发麻  | your lips and tongue getting numb. |
| 那我们为什么要吃  | Then why are we eating it? |
| 因为很好吃啊  | 'Cause it's yummy. |
| 好吧  | Sure. |
| 你环游中国是要做什么  | So, what were you doing wandering around China? |
| 我不做研究或教书的时候  | Well, when I'm not doing research or teaching |
| 我喜欢走上较少前人踏过之路  | I enjoy taking the path less traveled. |
| 我猜是那路还是单车路吧  | I'm guessing it's a bike path. |
| 还真是呢  | As a matter of fact, it was. ‭ |
| 在中国人人都骑自行车  | Everybody in China rides bicycles. |
| 太棒了  | It's fantastic. |
| -你去长城了吗  -我去了  | - Did you see the Great Wall? - ‭I did. |
| 有趣的事实  | Interesting fact: |
| 长城底下埋了许多  | it's filled with the dead bodies |
| 建筑工人的尸体  | of the people who built it. |
| 不会吧  | You don't say. |
| 有成千上万具尸体  | Hundreds of thousands of them. |
| 来尝一口  | Here, taste. |
| 如果只有我们俩  我为什么不能边吃边看电视  | If it's just the two of us, why can't I eat watching TV? |
| 因为你在跟你妈一起吃饭  | 'Cause you're having dinner with your mother |
| 这是我们交心的好机会  | and it's a chance for us to talk. |
| 谢尔顿就在边吃饭边看窗外啊  | Sheldon's having dinner and looking out the window. |
| 想要我叫他进来一起吃吗  | Want me to have him join us? |
| 不想  | No. |
| 那就别抱怨了  | Then quit complaining. |
| 你想聊什么  | So what do you want to talk about? |
| 我也不知道  | Um, I don't know. |
| 上学怎么样了  | How's school? |
| 那里可是学校  就是一坨屎  | It's school; it's a turd fest. |
| 真好  | Charming. |
| 你在跟谁交往吗  | Are you dating anyone? |
| 没有  没人配得上我  | Nah, nobody up to my standards. |
| 当然了  | Sure. |
| 我能问你个问题吗  | Can I ask you a question? |
| 当然可以  你想问什么都行  | Course, you can ask me anything. |
| 你跟爸结婚时是不是已经怀上我了  | Were you pregnant with me when you married Dad? |
| 你为什么会问这个  | Um... why would you ask that? |
| 谢尔顿说的  | Sheldon said so. |
| 谢尔顿怎么会知道  | How would Sheldon know? |
| 他算过了  | He did the math. |
| 算什么  | What math? |
| 他说我的生日  | He said the time between my birthday |
| 和你们举行婚礼那天相差六个月  | and your wedding day was six months. |
| 是啊  | Um... yeah. |
| 那是因为你...  | That's because you... |
| 是早产儿  | were born premature. |
| 我看过我的出生证  | I've seen my birth certificate |
| 上面写着我出生时是8斤巨婴  | it said I weighed nine pounds. |
| 没错  | Yes, that's true. |
| 你是个大胖早产儿  | You were a big fat preemie. |
| 我们聊点别的吧  | Let's talk about something else. |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 因为我非常想换话题  | 'Cause I'd very much like to. |
| 然后海瑟一号就说  | And then Heather B said she didn't want |
| 她以后不想跟海瑟二号玩绳球了  | to play tetherball with Heather M anymore. |
| 等等  有两个海瑟吗   | Wait. Th-There's two Heathers? |
| 是啊  | Oh, yeah. |
| 哪个是哪个来着  | Which one's which? |
| 海瑟一号是自大狂  | Heather B is stuck up. |
| 海瑟二号以前也是自大狂  | Heather M used to be stuck up |
| 但后来她戴上了脊椎侧弯支架  | but then she got a scoliosis brace. |
| 或许她不应该玩绳球  | Maybe she shouldn't be playing tetherball. |
| 海瑟一号就是这么说的  | That's what Heather B said. |
| 很美味  | This is delicious |
| 但你没夸张  真的好辣  | but you were not kidding about the spice. |
| 我都快辣出满头汗了  | I'm about to break a sweat here. |
| 有一个有趣的小知识  | Well, here's something you might find interesting. |
| 辣的食物通常都出自天气温暖的地方  | Spicy food is typically found in warmer climates |
| 因为吃辣能让人出汗  | because it induces sweating |
| 从而让大家凉快下来  | which in turn, cools people off. |
| 那流鼻水对我有什么好处  | So what does the runny nose do for me? |
| 让我有机会  | It allows me to, uh |
| 对你殷勤地献上我的手帕  | gallantly offer you my handkerchief. |
| 你真绅士  | You are such a gentleman. |
| 我年轻的时候  | When I was younger |
| 看了一本介绍礼仪的书  | I read a book on etiquette. |
| 我从上面学到  | That's how I know |
| 如果我有机会去梵蒂冈受到接见  | that if I ever have an audience at the Vatican |
| 我应该穿上晚礼服或男便装上衣  | I should wear evening attire or a sack coat. |
| 我不知道男便装上衣是什么  | I don't know what a sack coat is |
| 但你穿上一定很帅气  | but I'm sure you'd look handsome in it. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 晚上骑车回去很远  | You know, it's a long bike ride at night. |
| 如果你想的话  | If you want... |
| 欢迎你留下来过夜  | you're welcome to stay. |
| 没事  我的单车有车头灯  | No, it's fine, I-I have a headlight on my bicycle. |
| 当然了  当然  | Oh, sure, sure. |
| 不过  据说好像会下雨  | Although, I hear it might rain. |
| 不用担心  我有折叠雨衣  | No worries. I have a pocket poncho. |
| 好吧  | So you do. |
| 约翰  | John. |
| 我是在邀请你留下来过夜  | I'm inviting you to spend the night. |
| 不用了  谢谢  | No, thank you. |
| 早产婴儿不是都要  | Don't they make babies that are born too soon |
| 留院察看吗  | stay in the hospital? |
| 通常是的  但你出生时  | Normally, yes, but you were born |
| 有一头秀发  | with such a great head full of hair |
| 医院就让我们带你回家了  | that they sent you home with us. |
| 这是你刚才说的唯一合理的话  | That's the first thing you've said that makes sense. |
| 我很高兴我们一起吃晚餐  感觉很好  | I'm glad we had dinner; this was nice. |
| 是啊  很好玩  | Yeah, fun stuff. |
| 可不能错过《成长没烦恼》  | Well, don't want to miss Who's The Boss. |
| 主啊  原谅我说谎了  | Lord, forgive me for lying. |
| 等他30岁时我再告诉他真相  阿门  | I'll tell him the truth when he's 30. Amen. |
| 您的龙虾  女士  | Your lobster, madam. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 需要我帮她切开吗  | Would you like me to open it for her? |
| 我来就好  谢谢  | Oh, I got it, thanks. |
| -你还好吧  -这玩意好吓人   | - You all right? ‭- This thing's freaking me out. |
| 来吧  我来帮你  | Here, let me help you with that. |
| 挪一下  好了  | Here. Okay. |
| 秘诀在于别跟它对看  | The trick is not to make eye contact. |
| 跟它说去  | Tell him. |
| 来  | Here. |
| 好了  我们把龙虾钳子扯下来  | All right, now, we just... snap her off |
| 像这样  啪  | like that... pop. |
| 拿上工具  | Grab this guy here |
| 把钳子夹裂  | and we crack the claw. |
| 然后取出一些虾肉  | And then you take out a little meat... |
| 蘸一些牛油酱  | dunk it in some butter |
| 再放到嘴里  | and then you eat it. |
| 哎哟妈呀  | Holy moly. |
| 很好吃  对吧  | It's good, huh? |
| 难以置信  | Unbelievable. |
| 接下来你自己弄吧  | I'll leave you to it. |
| 别走  陪我坐  | No. Sit with me. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 等我长大后  我每晚都要吃龙虾  | When I grow up, I'm gonna eat lobster every night. |
| 宝贝  那你得好好读书  上所好学校    | Well, hon, you better stay in school and get a good education. |
| 我想着我就嫁给有钱人好了  | I was thinking I'd just marry a rich guy. |
| 当然  那样做也行  | Sure, that's a way to go. |
| 或是嫁给红龙虾餐厅的员工  | Or a guy who works at Red Lobster. |
| 这法子也可以  | That's another way to go. |
