| 大家早  | Hello. |

| 昨天跟丹对练柔道  所以有点浑身酸痛  | from doing jiu-jitsu with Tam yesterday. |

| 我就想有个清静的早晨  | I'd like one nice morning. |
| 为什么这事情你都不生气的  | Why aren't you more upset about this? |
| 我不高兴啊  但是我们应该小心处理  | I am. I just think we should proceed with caution. |
| -有人在伤害我们儿子  -我知道  | - Someone is hurting our son. - I understand. |
| 但处理恶霸的事很复杂  | But handling bullies is tricky. It... |
| 很容易弄巧成拙  害他更惨  | It's easy to make things worse. |
| 这事情你还是什么专家吗  | And what makes you the expert? |
| 亲爱的  我当年就是恶霸  | Honey, I was a bully. |
| 他说得对  | He's right. |
| 你用错误的方式插手此事  | You get involved in this in the wrong way, |
| 恶霸们就会在谢尔顿身上发泄  | and they'll take it out on Sheldon. |

| 我没有啊  学校里的大多数人都无视他  | I'm not. Most kids at school ignore him, |
| 而女生们全都觉得他很萌  | and the girls all think he's cute. |
| 还挺烦的  | It's kind of annoying. |
| 我希望你能照顾他  | Well, I need you to look after him. |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 因为我是你妈  而我现在在好好拜托你  | Because I'm your mother, and I'm asking you nicely. |
| 如果我不想呢  | What if I don't want to? |
| 我不管  让你做就做  | I don't care, you're doing it. |

| 当时我在城市上空飞翔  | So there I was flying above the city, |
| 但当我醒来后  我发现自己不能飞  | but when I woke up, I couldn't fly. |
| 就像是你上次梦到自己跟女神麦当娜交往  | That's like the dream you had where you were dating Madonna, |
| 结果梦醒后  发现并不是真的  | but when you woke up, you weren't. |
| 没错  | Exactly. |
| 那你梦过自己的牙齿在一颗颗掉吗  | You ever have the ones where your teeth are falling out? |
| 虽然说掉牙好过掉发啦  但...  | Better my teeth than my hair, but... |
| -谢尔顿  -在这里  | - Sheldon? - Over here. |
| -你在干嘛  -躲着  | - What are you doing? - Hiding. |
| 躲谁  | From who? |
| 欺负你的人就是比利吗  | Is Billy the one giving you trouble? |
| 不是  | No. |
| 是他爸爸吗  | His dad? |
| 也不是  | No. |
| 不是吧  | No... |
| 她就是个恶魔  | She's a demon. |
| 斯巴克斯家的小女儿吗  | The little Sparks girl? |
| 你开玩笑吧  感觉很乖的小女孩啊  | You're kidding. She seems so sweet. |
| 他说她打他  还抢他的午餐钱  | He says she slaps him around, takes his lunch money. |
| 还往他衣服里扔蝌蚪  | She even put a tadpole down his shirt. |
| 可怜啊  这孩子衣服都是扎裤子里的  | Poor kid, he tucks in those shirts. |
| -她看起来人畜无害啊  -她很可爱  | - She looks harmless. - She's cute. |
| 这样做坏事就很容易逃过责难  | So she probably gets away with stuff. |
| 我就像这样  | I'm like that. |
| 真好奇会不会有野猫把那里当猫砂用  | I wonder if stray cats poop in that sandbox. |
| 乔治  | George. |
| 你得去跟她家长谈谈  | You need to talk to her parents. |
| 我吗  为什么要我去  | Me? Why me? |
| 因为你比我更吓人啊  | Because you're more intimidating than me. |
| 这话她也好意思说  | That's rich. |
| 比利  | Hey, Billy. |
| 你好  米希的爸爸  | Hello, Missy's dad. |

| 能去帮我叫他来吗  | Could you get him for me? |
| 没问题  | Happy to. |
| 爸爸  米希的爸爸来了  | Dad, it's Missy's dad! |
| 他也是谢尔顿的爸爸  | He's also Sheldon's dad! |
| 你好啊  邻居  | Well, howdy, neighbor. |
| 你好啊  赫谢尔  | Hey, Herschel. |
| 怎么来了  是鸡太吵了吗  | What brings you by? Chickens too loud? |
| -没  它们挺好的  -那就好  | - Nah, they been fine. - Good, good. |
| 上周把吵的那只炸了  | Fried up the noisy one last week. |
| 这样它就安静了  所以今天来是有什么事呢  | That shut him up. Anyway, how can I help? |
| 这个嘛...  | Uh, well... |
| 我最近刚知道一件事...  | It's come to my attention that, uh... |
| 谢尔顿跟你们家女儿有点问题  | Sheldon's run into a bit of trouble with your daughter. |
| 什么问题  | What kind of trouble? |
| 谢尔顿说她总打他  | He says she been beating on him. |
| -我们家芭比吗  -是的  | - My Bobbi? - Yeah. |
| 就是我家这个六岁的闺女  | This one? The six-year-old? |
| 芭比  你过来  | Bobbi, get over here! |
| 你知道我拉过比这孩子还大的屎吧  | You realize I've taken dumps bigger than this kid. |
| -爹地  -乖女儿  | - Hi, Daddy. - Hey, babydoll, uh, |
| 库珀先生说你欺负他们家谢尔顿  | Mr. Cooper says that you've been picking on Sheldon. |
| -这是真的吗  -不是的  爹地  | - Now, is that true? - No, Daddy. |
| 确定吗  | Are you sure? |
| 行吧  去洗手准备吃晚饭  | Okay, go wash up for dinner. |
| 我不知道了  乔治  | I don't know what to tell you, George. |
| 你觉得会不会有可能  | I mean, is it, is it possible |
| 是你儿子有点暗恋她  | your son has a little crush on her? |
| 我感觉他应该没这个办法  | Oh, I don't think he's wired that way. |
| 你是想说他是同...  | Oh, are you saying that he's a... |
| 不是  我的意思是他就是个书呆子  | No, no, I'm saying he's a bookworm. |
| 除非她是数学或是字典  不然他应该没兴趣  | Unless she's math or a dictionary, he ain't interested. |
| 谢谢你听我说这事情  | Thanks for hearin' me out. |
| 是你老婆叫你过来的吧  | Your wife sent you over here, didn't she? |
| 我不想谈  | I don't want to talk about it. |
| 肯定是她  | I bet she did! |
| 我不想说  | Not talkin' about it! |
| 帮我跟她问个好  | Tell her I said hi! |
| 怎么样了  | How'd it go? |
| 挺好的  | Uh, good. Yeah. |
| 我处理好了  | I handled it. |
| 谢天谢地  | Oh, thank the Lord. |
| 是啊  谢我跟老天吧  | Yeah. Me and the Lord. |
| 我们合作的成果  | Team effort. |
| 芭比  你好  | Hello, Bobbi. |
| 你告我的状  | You told on me. |
| 其实是我哥哥想出来的  | Well, actually, my brother figured it out, |
| 所以严格来说  我觉得我没告发你  | so, technically, I would argue that I didn't. |
| 这不重要  | Doesn't matter. |
| 我应该告诉你  | Uh, I should let you know, |
| 我看了一本讲柔道的书  | I've read a book on jiu-jitsu. |
| 我准备好拿这本书丢你了  | And I'm prepared to throw it at you. |
| 谢利  这只是急救喷雾  | Shelly, it's just Bactine. |
| 我都还没涂到你身上  | I didn't even put it on you yet. |
| 你想告诉我发生什么事了吗  | You want to tell me what happened? |
| 芭比·斯巴克斯到车库里来了  | Bobbi Sparks came into the garage... |
| 她袭击你了吗  | And she attacked you? |
| 没有  我试图用柔道对付她  | Not exactly. I tried to use jiu-jitsu on her, |
| 但我绊倒了  | but I tripped and fell. |
| 宝贝  你得面对这些  我很抱歉  | Aw, baby. I'm so sorry you're havin' to deal with this. |
| 没关系  | It's okay. |
| 德国哲学家弗里德里希·尼采说过  | German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said, |
| "但凡不能杀死你的  最终都会使你更强大"  | "That which does not kill us makes us stronger." |
| 你觉得自己更强大了吗  | And do you feel stronger? |
| 没有  | No. |
| 膝盖怎么样了  | How are the knees? |
| 好多了  谢谢  | Better, thank you. |
| 那就好  | Good. |
| 至于柔道这件事  你该知道  | And regarding this jiu-jitsu stuff, you should know |
| 男人不应该对女人动手  | that a man's not supposed to raise his hand to a woman. |
| 我不会的  我不想又伤到自己  | Oh, I won't. I don't want to hurt myself again. |
| 你小时候遇到过恶霸吗  | Did you ever have a bully when you were growing up? |
| 你见过你姥姥了吗  | Have you met your grandma? |
| 你不是说邻居的事你处理好了  | I thought you said you handled it next door. |
| 我是那么说过  | I did say that. |
| 你要去哪儿  | Where you goin'? |
| 去处理此事  | To handle it. |
| 一开始就应该由你出面  | Should've been you in the first place. |
| 什么  | What? |
| 祝好运  | Good luck! |
| 真棒  史酷比  不愧是我的新闻狗仔  | Way to go, Scooby! That's my newshound! |
| 米希  我很需要你的帮助  | Missy, I could really use your help. |
| 帮什么  | With what? |
| 我被芭比·斯巴克斯欺负  | I'm being bullied by Bobbi Sparks. |
| 笑死人  继续说  | Hilarious. Go on. |
| 妈妈说男人绝对不可以打女人  | Mom says a man should never raise his hand to a woman. |
| 但我想  我找到了空子可钻  | But I believe I've found a loophole. |
| 你是女人  所以你可以尽情揍她  | You're a woman, so you're allowed to hit her as much as you want. |
| 我为什么要揍她  | Why would I do that? |
| 因为我愿意付钱给你  | Because I'm willing to pay you. |
| 多少钱  | How much? |
| 我毕生积蓄  4美刀  | My life savings, four dollars. |
| 这是个好开始  | That's a good start. |
| 现在我们再来谈谈电视使用权  | Now, let's talk TV privileges. |
| 你想怎么样  | What do you want? |
| 接下来的两个月  每天下午看什么都由我决定  | Complete control every afternoon for two months. |
| 《质子教授》就是在那个时段播出  | That's when Professor Proton is on. |
| 我知道  你真惨  | I know. Sucks for you. |
| 我可牛逼了  | I'm on fire! |
| 你好啊  布兰达  | Hello, Brenda. |
| 你好  玛丽  | Oh, hey, Mary. |
| 你要开几条道  | How many lanes you need? |
| 其实我是有话要跟你说  | Actually, I'm here to talk to you. |
| 我们的孩子之间好像有点小问题  | Seems that our kids are havin' a little problem. |
| 对  赫谢尔告诉我了  | Yeah. Herschel told me. |
| 好  那就好  | Oh, good, good. |
| 我想知道你打算如何处理  | So, I was wondering what you're plannin' to do about it, |
| 因为情况好像没有任何好转  | 'cause the situation doesn't seem to be gettin' any better. |
| 如果你还没注意到  | Well, if you haven't noticed, |
| 我正工作呢  | I'm at work right now. |
| 我看出来了  | I see that. |
| 但你知道  | But you understand |
| 你女儿在欺负我儿子吧  | that your daughter's being abusive to my son. |
| 或许你儿子需要长点胆子[蛋蛋]  | Well, maybe your son needs to grow a pair. |
| 等时候到了  他会的  | And in due time, he will. |
| 但现在  我请你  | But right now, I expect you |
| 教好你孩子如何做人  | to teach your children how to behave. |
| 康妮·塔克请到前台来  | Connie Tucker to the front desk, please. |
| 康妮·塔克  | Connie Tucker. |
| 你干嘛呼叫她  | Why are you calling her? |
| 你说我女儿在骚扰你儿子  | You say my daughter's harassing your son. |
| 她女儿也在骚扰我  | Well, her daughter's harassing me. |
| 玛丽  | Hey, Mary. |
| 你怎么来了  | What are you doin' here? |
| 我本来希望能理智地跟她谈谢利的事  | Well, I was hopin' to have a rational conversation about Shelly, |
| 但表现理智的人只有一个  | but there's only one person being rational. |
| 而那人不是你  | Uh, and it ain't you. |
| 我们先失陪一下  | Could you excuse us for just a minute? |
| 你知道你现在所处的地方  | Do you understand that you are in the place |
| 我每周都要在这社交三到四天吗  | where I socialize three to four days a week? |
| 你觉得保龄球比你外孙还重要吗  | So you care more about bowling than your grandson? |
| 当然不是  我只是说  | Of course not. I'm just saying |
| 也许有更好的解决方法  | maybe there's a better way to go about it. |
| 我提醒你  布兰达可是个恶毒的...  | Now, I'm warnin' you, Brenda is one mean-- |
| 我不知道你不喜欢脏话  | I know you don't like bad language, |
| 但我们正在保龄球馆...  恶毒的婊子  | but we are in a bowling alley-- one mean bitch. |
| 我也可以很恶毒  | Well, I can be mean, too. |
| 你给我听好了  | Okay, you listen to me. |
| 你叫你孩子规矩点  否则我...  | You get your kid in line or I... |
| 你这是干什么  | What are you doing? |
| 滚出去  | Get out of here. |
| 这里是我做生意的地方  | This is my place of business. |
| 现在我知道你女儿是学了谁了  | And now I see where your daughter gets it. |
| 知道吗  | You know what? |
| 从你们一家搬进来那天起  | I have been nothin' but nice |
| 我一直都对你们礼貌有加  | to you and your family since the day y'all moved in, |
| 但我不会再那样了  | and I'm over it. |
| 看着你自以为是地走来走去  | Watching you walk around all holier than thou, |
| 觉得自己比其他人都优越  | like you're better than everyone else. |
| 你猜怎么着  | Well, guess what, |
| 你才不是  | you're not. |
| 老娘会狠狠地为你祈祷  | I'm gonna pray for you. |
| 她总对我那么说  | She says that to me all the time. |
| 我都不知道她是否真会那么做  | I'm not even sure she does it. |
| 进行得怎么样  | How'd it go? |
| 我不想说这事  | I don't want to talk about it. |
| 那是松木消毒剂的味道吗  | Is that pine? |
| 我们不说这个  | We're not talkin' about it. |
| 你去开门  | And you get that! |
| 赫谢尔  | Herschel. |
| 你好  乔治  | Hey, George. |
| 我最近刚知道一件事...  | It has come to my attention |
| 你老婆去我老婆工作的地方找她了  | that your wife went to speak with my wife at her place of work, |
| -然后...  -她派你来这的吗  | - and, uh... - She send you over here? |
| 重点是  我来这是要告诉你  | Uh, the-the important thing is that I'm here to tell you |
| 玛丽的行为很不恰当  | that, uh, Mary's behavior was inappropriate. |
| 挺有意思的  | You know, it's interesting. |
| 我去你家时  你笑脸相迎  | When I came to your house, you were laughin', |
| 现在  | and... |
| 你却板着一张脸  | now you're all serious. |
| 为什么呢  | Why is that? |
| 我们到更自在的地方谈  | What do you say we go talk about this |
| 你说怎么样  | somewhere a little more comfortable? |
| 在门口的是谁  | Who's at the door? |
| 你请自便  | Make yourself at home. |
| 老天  | Oh, boy. |
| 你都在这消磨时间吗  | You hang out in here? |
| 是的  | Sure. |
| 一旦习惯了这股味儿  | Once you get used to the smell, |
| 这里还不太糟  | it's not so bad. |
| 我是高中橄榄球队教练  | I coach a high school football team. |
| 这里闻起来像牵牛花般清新  | This smells like petunias. |
| 我喜欢...  | I like to... |
| 暂时躲开家人  | take a break from the family and... |
| 到这里来看比赛  | come out here and watch the games. |
| 你老婆不介意吗  | Your wife don't mind? |
| 她不知道  | She don't know. |
| 她怕死鸡了  | She's scared to death of chickens. |
| -是吗  -我一知道  | - Is that right? - Once I found out, |
| 就立刻决定建这个鸡舍  | buildin' this coop was a no-brainer. |
| 你去了好久  | You were gone so long. |
| 进行得怎么样  | How did it go? |
| 这个嘛  | Well... |
| 加一块糖还是两块  | One lump or two? |
| 两块  谢谢  | Two, please. |
| 比利呢  | Billy? |
| 我为什么要喝甜的茶  | Why would I want lumpy tea? |
| 他多美啊  对不对  | Isn't he pretty? |
| 美呆了  | Very pretty. |
| 我感觉自己很美  | I feel pretty. |
| 我处理好了  | I handled it. |
| 太谢谢你了  | Thank you so much. |
| 我们是一家人  应该的  | We're family. It's what we do. |
| 真不好意思  我老婆到保龄球馆去了  | Listen, I'm sorry my wife went down to the bowling alley. |
| 拜托  我才不好意思  布兰达逼我去你家  | Please, I'm sorry Brenda made me come to your door. |
| 我倒不介意  | I'm not. |
| 这是我一星期以来最开心的一天了  | This is the most fun I've had all week. |
| 孩子们有矛盾  我心里也不好过  | I-I feel bad about the whole thing with the kids. |
| 这常有的事  | Hey, it happens. |
| 我知道  但芭比不应该那样欺负谢尔顿  | I know, but Bobbi shouldn't be beatin' on Sheldon like that. |
| -那是不对的  -真正不对的  | - It's not okay. - What's not okay |
| 是谢尔顿竟然被一个小女孩欺负  | is Sheldon gettin' beat up by a little girl. |
| 这个嘛  | Well... |
| 也对啦  | Yeah. |
| 我会跟芭比谈谈  | Look, I'll talk to Bobbi. |
| 不知道会不会有帮助  但我会尽力  | I don't know if it'll help, but I'll try. |
| 你是个好人  | Hey, you're a good man. |
| 我该回去了  | Yeah, I-I should be headin' back. |
| 好的  随时欢迎你来  | All right, well, look, come on by anytime. |
| 好  | Yeah. |
| 我们最好先把故事编圆  | You know, we should probably get our stories straight |
| 再跟我们各自的...  | before we talk to our respective... |
| -伴侣说  -好  | - mates. - Sure. |
| 你想说什么  | What do you want to say? |
| 这个怎么样  | How 'bout this? |
| 我们发生争吵  | We had words, |
