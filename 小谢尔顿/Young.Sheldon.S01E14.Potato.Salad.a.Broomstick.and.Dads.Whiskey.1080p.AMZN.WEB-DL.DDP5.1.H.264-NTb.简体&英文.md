| 我很高兴来跟各位报告  我的土豆沙拉  | Well, I am happy to report that my potato salad |
| 又再度成为换菜大餐的热门榜首  | is once again the hit of the potluck. |
| -很棒啊  老婆  -感觉对不起潘姆·斯特普尔斯  | - That's great, honey. ?- I feel bad for Pam Staples. |
| 都没人要吃她的土豆沙拉  | No one's touching her potato salad. |
| 如果你觉得对不起人家  那你为什么在笑  | If you feel bad, then why are you smiling? |
| 因为有时候你妈就是个伪君子  | 'Cause sometimes your mommy's a big ol' hypocrite. |
| 库珀一家好啊  你们今天好吗  | Howdy, Coopers! How we doing today? |
| -杰夫牧师  -谢谢问候  杰夫牧师  | - Pastor Jeff. - Thank you, Pastor Jeff. |
| 你们还记得我太太萨琳娜吗  | Y'all remember my wife Selena. |
| -你好啊  萨琳娜  -记得  | - Hi, Selena. - ?Oh, yeah. |
| 你们好[西语]  | Que tal? |
| 你娶了她吗  | You're married to her? |
| 怎么啦  是啊  | Why, yes, I am. |
| 有些事你可以想  但你不能说出来  | You can think it-- you don't need to say it. |
| 你还喜欢梅德福吗  萨琳娜  | How are you liking Medford, Selena? |
| 你喜欢梅德福吗[西语]  | Como te gusta Medford? |
| 她喜欢  | She likes it fine. |
| 她需要去洗手间一下  | She needs to use the little girls' room. |
| 玛丽  我能跟你谈两句吗  | Mary, could I talk to you for a second? |
| 没问题  | Sure. |
| 别担心  我会很快带她回来  | Don't worry. I'll bring her right back. |
| 不担心  不过行吧  | Wouldn't worry, but okay. |
| 好的  | Okay. |
| 他的西语好差啊  | His Spanish is terrible. |
| 她说的完全不是那么回事  | That's not what she said at all. |
| 不知道你有没有听说  | I don't know if you've heard, |
| 但我们教堂秘书  | but our church secretary, |
| 伊丽莎白·索恒奇  最近要去接受治疗  | Elizabeth Sohinki, is currently seeking treatment |
| 处理一下有关...  应该说是  | for a little problem with-- shall we say-- |
| 不合法药品的成瘾症  | under-the-counter medications. |
| 所以那个谣言是真的  | Oh. So that rumor's true. |
| 她的确是整天看起来都神经兮兮  | ?Well, she did always seem extremely alert. |
| 神经兮兮  摇摇晃晃  大汗淋漓  反正呢  | Alert, shaky, sweaty. Anyway, |
| 我们需要有人挺身而出  接过她的职位  | we need someone to step in and fill the position. |
| 不知道你有没有兴趣考虑一下  | I was wondering if you might consider it. |
| 不只是记账  | It's not just bookkeeping. |
| 还得负责所有的修缮工作  你懂的  | I'd be in charge of handling the maintenance issues-- you know, |
| 水管电路  诸如此类  | plumbing, electric, what have you. |
| 而且我还成为了计划委员会的领导  | And I'd also head the planning committee |
| 所有的社交活动  | for all the social events, |
| 当然  也包含了三大活动  | which, of course, includes the big three: |
| 洗礼  婚礼与丧礼  | baptisms, weddings, funerals. |
| 锦上添花的部分来了  | And here is the cherry on top. |
| 教堂前面那个写着妙语的告示牌  | The sign in front of the church with all the clever sayings... |
| "做个器官捐赠者  把心捐给耶稣"  | "Be an organ donor, give your heart to Jesus"? |
| 没错  | Exactly. |
| 你猜以后会是谁的职责  | Guess whose job it would be to write those. |
| 你的  | Yours. |
| 我已经开始想了几个了  | Already working on a couple. |
| 听听这个  | Listen to this. |
| "B1  基督徒最佳维他命"  | "The best vitamin for a Christian is B1." |
| 啥玩意  | What? |
| B1音似"当个"  | You know, be one. |
| 当个基督徒就是最佳维他命  | Like be a Christian. |
| B1本身也是一种维他命  | And also B1 the vitamin. |
| 听了你解释之后就好笑了  | Well, now that you explained it, it's funny. |
| 是啦  这个需要稍微想一下  | Yeah. Might be a thinker. |
| 但我还有源源不绝的各种妙语呢  | But there's a lot more where that came from. |
| 那双胞胎谁照顾  | What about the twins? |
| 我还是会每天载他们去上学  | Well, I'll still get 'em off to school every day. |
| 等他们回家了  | And when they get home, |
| 我妈可以帮我照顾他们到我回家  | Mom can keep an eye on 'em till I get back. |
| 你觉得她会同意吗  | Think she'll go for it? |
| 这还用说  我妈爱死他们了  | Are you kidding? She loves 'em like crazy. |
| 想得美啊  | Fat chance. |
| 你干嘛呀  | Oh, come on. |
| 你才干嘛呀  老娘正在人生巅峰  | You come on. I'm in the prime of my life. |
| 我得去做水上有氧跟跳萨尔萨舞  | I got my water aerobics and my salsa dancing |
| 还有保龄球队联赛  | and my bowling league. |
| 但你爱你的孙子孙女啊  | But you love your grandchildren. |
| 我也爱冰激凌  但这不代表我就会  | I love ice cream, too, but I don't want to eat it |
| 周一到周五每天下午3点吃到6点  | 3:00 to 6:00 five days a week. |
| 我对你好失望  | Well, I'm very disappointed. |
| 我完全无所谓  | And I'm fine with that. |
| 你为什么不去请个保姆呢  | Why don't you just get a babysitter? |
| 这样我去赚外快不就白费了吗  | Kinda defeats the purpose of making extra money. |
| 是啊  | Oh, yeah, right. |
| 好吧  我想想  | All right, let's think about it. |
| 小乔治呢  | Georgie. |
| 他有橄榄球练习  | Football practice. |
| 而且连我在家的时候我都不放心他了  | And I don't trust him when I'm home. ?Oh. |
| 好吧  不过我们在这穷担心什么呢  | Okay, now, what are we talking about here? |
| 谢尔顿又聪明又有责任感  | Sheldon is intelligent and responsible, |
| 而米希...  是他姐姐  | and Missy... is his sister. |
| 我觉得他们放学后  | I think they'll be fine home alone |
| 独自在家几个小时应该没事  | all by themselves for a couple hours after school. |
| -你这么觉得吗  -真的  | - You think? - I do. |
| 而且呢  我觉得这对他们也有好处  | As a matter of fact, I actually think it'll be great for them. |
| 这年头的孩子就是温室的花朵  | These kids today are so coddled, |
| 我觉得你们这一辈人  | I honestly think y'all are raising |
| 把下一代的人全养成小娘炮了  | a whole generation of sissies. |
| 你这样说你的孙子们真的好吗  | Is that the way you speak about your grandchildren? |
| 好啊  | Yes. |

| 我回来了  | Hi. |
| 跟你妈谈的如何  | How'd it go with your mom? |
| 她没兴趣照顾孩子们  | She's not interested in watching 'em. |
| 不想放弃她每天下午的安排  | Doesn't want to give up her afternoons. |
| 不意外  抱歉啊  | Of course. Sorry. |
| 算啦  没关系  | You know what, it's okay. |
| 时候不对  | The timing wasn't right. |
| 或许等孩子大了吧  | Maybe when the kids are older. |
| 好  | Okay. |
| 我去做晚饭吧  | I guess I'll go get dinner started. |
| 要不这样吧  | How about this? |
| 你就去接了这份工作  | Go ahead and take the job. |
| 如果接了之后发现  | Yeah, if it turns out |
| 谢尔顿与米希没办法放学后  | Sheldon and Missy can't look out for themselves |
| 好好照顾自己几个小时  | for a couple hours after school, |
| 那...  我们到时候再解决那个问题  | then... well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. |
| 你确定吗  | Are you sure about this? |
| 是啊  其实这样对他们也有好处  | Yeah. Actually, probably good for 'em. |
| 教导他们要担起责任  | Teach 'em a little responsibility. |
| 我妈妈也是这么说的呢  | That's exactly what my mom said. |
| 是吗  | Really? |
| 那我还是一样喜欢这个主意  | Well, I still like the idea. |
| 感谢主  赐予我们桌上的食物  | Thank you, God, for this food we're about to receive, |
| 为我们的身体提供营养  | and for the nourishment of our bodies, |
| 也保佑准备这餐点的人  | and bless the hands that prepared it. |
| 阿门  | Amen. |
| 字幕  | So, kids, |
| 我们家有件事情要讨论一下  | we have a little family business to discuss. |
| -你怀孕了吗  -没有  | - You're pregnant? - No. |
| -我们要养狗狗吗  -没有  | - We're getting a puppy? - No. |
| 那我很可能不会在乎  | I'm not sure I care. |
| 从下周一开始  | Starting next Monday, |
| 我会在教堂做一份全职工作  | I'm gonna take a full-time job at the church. |
| 那谁来照顾我们呢  | Well, who's going to take care of us? |
| 一切都不会有改变  我还是会做早餐  | Well, nothing will change in the morning-- I'll make breakfast, |
| 带你们俩去学校  你们放学后呢  | take you both to school. Then, after school, |
| 你们就回家  开始写作业  | you'll come home, do your homework, |
| 看看电视  玩玩具  | watch TV, play with your toys |
| 等我6点左右回家  | till I come home around 6:00. |
| 为什么姥姥不能来照顾我们呢  | Well, why can't Meemaw take care of us? |
| -因为她不是你认为的那种人...  -乔治  | - 'Cause she's not the person you think she is. - George... |
| 你真的要独自留他们两个在家吗  | You're really gonna leave these two alone? |
| 是啊  | Yes. |
| 很大胆的选择啊  | That's a brave choice. |
| 听好了  这工作对你妈来说很重要  | Look, this job is important to your mother. |
| 我们希望你们能挺身而出  为他担起责任  | We expect you both to step up and be responsible. |
| 我可以做到  | I can do that. |
| 米希  | Missy? |
| 我考虑考虑  | I'm thinking about it. |
| 十分大胆  | Very brave. |
| 好的  我们再来过一遍  | Okay, let's go over it one more time. |
| 家里的钥匙在前门的塑料猫头鹰下  | House key's under the plastic owl by the front door. |
| 下午的点心在冰箱里  | There's after-school snacks in the fridge. |
| 一人一份  | One for each of you. |
| 紧急联络电话就写在电话旁  | Emergency numbers are right there by the phone. |
| 急救箱就在走廊橱柜里  | First aid kit is in the hall closet. |
| 虽然你们不会用到  | And you won't be needing it, |
| 但厨房水槽下有灭火器  | but under the kitchen sink is a fire extinguisher. |
| 感觉好有意思啊  | Ooh, that looks fun. |
| 起火了才能用  也不许为了玩而放火  | For fires only, and don't be starting one just to use it. |
| 她仿佛会读心术  | It's like she can read my mind. |
| 妈妈你别担心  | Don't worry, Mom. |
| 我们不会让你失望  | We'll make you proud. |
| 我知道你不会的  宝贝  | I know you will, baby. |
| 准备好第一天上班了吗  | All set for your first day? |
| 应该好了  | I believe I am. |
| 大展拳脚吧  | Go get 'em. |
| 感谢你吵我起来啊  | Thanks for waking me up. |
| 我40分钟前就叫你起床了  | I woke you up 40 minutes ago. |
| 那你这工作做得不太好啊  | Well, you didn't do a very good job. |
| 大家再见啦  | Bye, y'all. |
| 好  行  行  | Okay, yeah. Yeah. |
| 好的  再见  | Okay, later. |
| 抱歉打扰了  佩佩   杰夫牧师有空吗  | Sorry to bother you, Peg, is Pastor Jeff available? |
| 杰夫  你有空吗  | Jeff! You available?! |
| 在打电话  | On the phone. |
| 他在打电话  | He's on the phone. |
| 我母亲戒烟的时候  | You know, my mother's had some luck cutting back on the smoking |
| 嚼尼古丁口香糖还挺有效  | by chewing that nicotine gum. |
| 正嚼着呢  | Got some right here. |
| 你有啊  | So you do. |
| 请进  | Come on in. |
| 去吧  你听到他说了吧  | Go on, you heard him. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 你好啊  玛丽  | Hey, Mare. |
| 需要的东西都有了吧  | Uh, you finding everything you need? |
| 当然啦  | Oh, you bet. |
| 跟你说  我看了看帐  | So, I've been going over the books, |
| 我觉得我们够钱来购买  | and I think we have enough money in our budget |
| 一台个人电脑  | to purchase a personal computer |
| 来处理所有教堂事务  | to handle all the church business. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 不如你把文件都留在这里  | Well, uh, why don't you leave the paperwork here, |
| 我再抽空看看  | and I'll-I'll take a look at it. |
| 没问题  | Of course. |
| 请您审阅  | That's for your perusal. |
| 没问题吧  | Everything okay? |
| 什么  | What? |
| 没问题  一切妥妥儿的  | Yeah. Right as rain. |
| 那就好  | All righty. |
| 如果你有空  | Hey, if you have a minute, |
| 我想跟你谈一下教堂前的告示牌标语  | I would love to talk to you about the sign out front. |
| 没问题啊  | Yeah, sure. |
| 一切顺利  | So far so good. |
| 有人在吗  | Hello? |
| 有人在家吗  | Anybody? |
| 他们还真不是开玩笑  | They weren't kidding. |
| 我就去偷看一眼吧  | Maybe I'll just have one little peek. |
| 你怎么不吃你的点心  | How come you're not eating your snack? |
| 我喜欢把点心当成我功课做得好的奖赏  | I prefer my snack to be a reward for homework well done. |
| 你就像一位老人  | You're like an old person. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 你的功课是什么  | What's your homework? |
| 非欧几何  | Non-Euclidean geometry. |
| 你的呢  | How about you? |
| "同一词"  | "Symonyms." |
| 是同义词吧  | You mean synonyms. |
| 我挺确定老师是说"同一词"  | I'm pretty sure she said "Symonyms." |
| 你看到了吗  | Did you see that? |
| 有人在外面  | Someone's out there. |
| 惨了  来到我们后院了  | Oh, no. They're in the backyard. |
| 我们该怎么办  | What do we do? |
| 你们谁去给我拿个毛巾  | Would one of you please get me a towel? |
| 你为什么要在外面鬼鬼祟祟  | Why were you sneaking around out there? |
| 你吓到我们了  | Yeah, you scared us. |
| 我是来看看你们俩好不好  | I was checking up on you two. |
| 要是你们关心的话  是的  我也被吓到了  | And in case you're wondering, you scared me back. |
| 那你为什么不敲门  | Well, why didn't you knock? |
| 因为你们俩应该自己照顾好自己  | Because you two are supposed to be doing this on your own. |
| 而你不觉得我们做得到  | And you don't think we can. |
| 我当然觉得可以啦  | Of course I do. |
| 就是我告诉你妈妈  | I'm the one who told your mother |
| 你们两个可以照顾好自己的  | that you were fine by yourselves in the first place. |
| 那你为什么还来检查  | Then why were you checking up on us? |
| 这叫表里不一  | That's called being two-faced. |
| 我们自己没事的  | We'll be okay on our own. |
| 我们也得证明我们可以  | Yeah, we need to prove we can do this. |
| 好吧  | All right. |
| 我尊重你们的心  | I respect that. |
| 我也很乐意为你们保守这小小意外的秘密  | And I'm happy to keep this little incident a secret. |
| 是吗  我要告诉大家  | Really? I'm telling everyone. |
| 太好笑了  | It was hilarious. |
| 我要去打保龄球了  | I'm going bowling. |
| 我们一开始交往时  一切都很美妙  | When we first started dating, everything was wonderful. |
| 刚交往的确都会很美妙啊  | That's when it is wonderful. |
| 我们一结婚问题就统统跑出来了  | All the problems started once we got married. |
| 婚姻的确是会对感情造成问题  | Well, marriage will do that to a relationship. |
| 我给萨琳娜一张信用卡  | I-I got Selena a credit card |
| 让她添购家用物品时用  | to make small purchases for the house. |
| 比如说咖啡机  吸尘器  | You know... ...coffee maker, DustBuster. |
| 你知道她干嘛了吗  | You know what she did? |
| 她跑去电器用品店  | She went to that Sharper Image store |
| 买了一张按摩椅  | and she bought a massage chair. |
| 我在商场也坐过一次  | Oh, I sat in one of those at the mall. |
| 超舒服啊  | It was terrific. |
| 要两千刀呢  | It's $2,000. |
| 在看过你的帐之后  | Oh. Well, seeing as I know how much you make, |
| 我知道你买不起这个  | you can't afford that. |
| 我...  | I... uh-uh. |
| 在所有小孩能  | Of all the afflictions |
| 碰到的危险磨难中  有一个危险之王  | that can befall a child, one reigns supreme. |
| 超越擦破膝盖与被纸割伤  | Beyond scraped knees and paper cuts, |
| 没有什么在全球孩子的心里造成的恐惧  | nothing strikes fear into the hearts of kids around the world |
| 能超越倒刺  | like a splinter. |
| 不要啊  | No! |
| 我被倒刺刺到了  | I've got a splinter! |
| 所以呢  | So? |
| 所以这是紧急事态啊  | So, it's an emergency! |
| 快打给姥姥  | Call Meemaw! |
| 冷静好吗  | Oh, calm down. |
| -我们自己能搞定  -我们不能  | - We can take care of this. - No, we can't! |
| 谢尔顿  如果连个小倒刺都搞不定  | Sheldon, if we can't handle a little splinter, |
| 他们永远也不会再让我们自己在家了  | they're never gonna leave us alone again. |
| 你说得对  | You're right. |
| 那我们该怎么做  | So, what do we do? |
| 让我看看  | Let me see it. |
| 哎哟  还挺深的  | Oh, boy. That's a deep one. |
| 痛得好厉害啊  | Hey, it's throbbing really bad. |
| 妈通常都是用镊子夹出来  | Mom would take it out with tweezers. |
| 那我们上哪找镊子  | Well, where would we find tweezers? |
| 看看这里有什么工具  | Let's see what we got. |
| 邦迪  | Band-Aids... |
| 棉球  | cotton balls. |
| 什么是"纱扑"  | What's "Gowz"? |
| 是纱布  而你连这是什么都不知道  | It's gauze, and the fact that you don't know that |
| 真是把希望之火又灭了不少  | is not filling me with hope. |
| 妈妈会把镊子收在哪里呢  | Where would Mom keep the tweezers? |
| -她有时候也会用针挑出倒刺啊  -不行  | - Sometimes she uses a needle on splinters. - ?No. |
| 不许用针  除了针什么都可以  | No needles. Anything but needles. |
| 等等  她的化妆包里有镊子  | Wait, she has tweezers in her makeup bag. |
| 她用镊子来拔眉毛  | She plucks her eyebrows with them. |
| 有时候还拔她的小胡子  | And sometimes her mustache. |
| 找到了吗  | Anything? |
| 没有  | Nope. |
| 等等  | Wait. |
| 或许是收在他们房里  | Maybe they're in her room. |
| 我们不允许进爸妈的房里  | We're not allowed to go in Mom and Dad's room. |
| 你要我用针帮你挑吗  | Want me to get the needle? |
| 我们速战速决吧  | Let's make this quick. |
| 你为什么要小声说话  | Why are you whispering? |
| 大家在不乖的时候就是这么说话的  | That's how people speak when they're being naughty. |
| 这我就不会知道了  | I wouldn't know. |
| 因为我没有一刻是乖的  | I'm naughty all the time. |
| 你真的不进来吗  | You're really not coming in? |
| 不进  但你做得不错  | No. But you're doing great. |
| 怎么了  | What's wrong? |
| 这样真的好不乖啊  | This really is naughty. |
| 我跟你说了  | I told you. |
| 没有看到呢  | I don't see anything. |
| 就看到一本圣经跟手电筒  | There's just a Bible and a flashlight. |
| 我该怎么办  | What do I do? |
| 接起来  但语气保持冷静  | Answer it but sound calm. |
| 你好  | Hello. |
| 你好啊  是爸爸  | Hey, it's Dad. |
| 你们俩还好吗  | How you guys doing? |
| 我们很好  | We're great. |
| 那就太好了  | Glad to hear it. |
| 我在看电视  | I'm watching TV, |
| 谢尔顿在安静地阅读  | and Sheldon's reading quietly. |
| 我就知道你们俩没问题  | I knew you could handle this. |
| -爸爸为你们感到骄傲  -其实呢  | - I'm proud of you. - You know what? |
| 我们也为自己感到骄傲  | I'm proud of us, too. |
| 好啦  宝贝闺女  | Okay, baby doll, |
| 我几个小时后就回家了  | I'll be home in a couple hours. |
| 今晚不回家也没事  我们可以的  | Stay out all night. We got this. |
| 什...  我也爱你们  | Wha... Love you, too. |
| 真是太紧张了  | That was intense. |
| 我觉得我不适合这种留守儿童的生活  | I don't think I'm cut out for this latchkey life. |
| 这次换你去接  | You answer it this time. |
| 不可以  我现在应该在安静读书才对啊  | I can't; I'm supposed to be reading quietly. |
| 去接  谢尔顿  | Answer it, Sheldon. |
| 我要接也不进去接  | Well, I'm not going in there. |
| 您好  这里是库珀家  | Hello. Cooper residence. |
| 我是谢尔顿  | Sheldon speaking. |
| 谢利  | Hey, Shelly. |
| 是你啊  妈妈  | Oh, hello, Mom. |
| 你今天过得好吗  | How's your day going? |
| 谢利  | Shelly? |
| 谢利  谢利  你在吗  | Shelly? Shelly? You there? |
| 我在啊  | Yes, I'm here. |
| 她想知道我今天好吗  | She wants to know how my day's going. |
| 你就会今天好啊  | Say it's going good. |
| 我不能这么说  | I can't say that. |
| 为什么  | Why not? |
| 因为这样文法不对  | It's bad grammar. |
| 那你应该怎么说才对  | How are you supposed to say it? |
| "我今天很好"  | "It's going well." |
| 你好就好  | Oh, that's nice. |
| 我得继续工作了  | I've got to get back to work, |
| 但妈咪很爱你跟米希哦  | but I love you and miss you very much. |
| 好  | Okay. |
| 我处理得十分妥当  | I handled that really well. |
| 有空吗  | Got a minute? |
| 有啊  请进  | Sure, come on in. |
| 我想跟你道歉  | I just wanted to apologize. |
| 让你听我倾诉这些个人烦恼是不对的  | I-It was wrong of me to unload my personal business on you. |
| 而且你还是第一天来上班呢  | Here it is, your first day and all. |
| 没事啦  | Oh, that's fine. |
| 我十分乐意听人倾诉  | Always happy to lend an ear. |
| 那就好  因为我还没说完全部呢  | Great, 'cause I didn't tell you everything. |
| 真的吗  你已经说了非常多了呢  | Really? 'Cause you told me a lot. |
| 今天早上我趁萨琳娜去洗澡的时候  | This morning, while Selena was in the shower, |
| 我翻了她的皮包  把信用卡拿回来了  | I went through her purse and I took the credit card. |
| 天啊  | Oh, my. ? |
| 你觉得这算偷吗  还是我做的是正确的选择  | Now, do you think that's stealing, or is it doing the right thing? |
| 让我们免于破产之类的问题  | You know, saving us from bankruptcy and whatnot? |
| 这事还挺复杂的  | Wow. Um, yeah, that's complicated. |
| 翻她钱包这件事  应该是不对的  | Um... going through her purse-- probably wrong, |
| 不过换个角度来看...  | but on the other hand... |
| 没别的角度了  | ...well, there is no other hand. |
| 你不能做这种事情  | You can't be doing things like that |
| 然后还想有正常的婚姻关系啊  | and have a healthy marriage. |
| 你为什么不跟她谈谈呢  | Why don't you just talk to her? |
| 跟她说说你的经济情况  | Explain your financial situation? |
| 这个嘛...  | That... |
| 现在还要关上门谈了吗  | Oh, we're closing the door now, okay. |
| 跟她谈有些困难  | That's not so easy. |
| 因为语言障碍吗  | Because of the language barrier? |
| 除此之外  在我们刚交往那会儿  | That, and I implied, when we were dating, |
| 我暗示过我...  颇有资产  | that I was... well-to-do. |
| 杰夫牧师  你怎么能做这种事呢  | Oh, Pastor Jeff, why would you do that? |
| 你也见过她了  | You saw her. |
| 她就是那一种  | Uh, she is the kind of woman |
| 会让人忍不住想做坏事的女人啊  | that can make a man do bad things. |
| 这话...  我就不知道作何评价了  | Well, I... I don't know what to say to that. |
| 或许你该祈祷吧  | Maybe you ought to pray on it. |
| 你说得对  | You're right. |
| 你说的完全正确  | You're absolutely right. |
| 我现在就去  | I'll do that now. |
| 我也会祈祷  | I'll do the same. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 主啊  请求您赐我力量  | God, please give me the strength |
| 让我能不说出杰夫牧师的超级大八卦  | to not spread this juicy gossip about Pastor Jeff. |
| 阿门  | Amen. |
| 你在干嘛  | What are you doing? |
| 我在安静地阅读  免得之后我得说谎  | I'm reading quietly, so I don't have to lie about it later. |
| 找到啦  | Found 'em. |
| 镊子吗  | The tweezers? |
| 妈妈的针跟放大镜  | Mom's needles and her magnifying glass. |
| 绝对不行  | Absolutely not. |
