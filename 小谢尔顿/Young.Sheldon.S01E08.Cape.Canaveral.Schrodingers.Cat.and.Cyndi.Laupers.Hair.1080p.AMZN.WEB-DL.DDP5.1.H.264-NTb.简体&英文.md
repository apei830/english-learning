| 我还以为你不喜欢乱喊"神啊"  | I thought you didn't like taking the Lord's name in vain? |
| 你闭嘴啦  | Oh, shut up. |
| 好一阵子没"做"了吧  | It's been a while, huh? |
| 不能怪我  | Don't blame me. |
| 犯心脏病的人是你又不是我  | You're the one who had a heart attack. |
| 医生的确有说让我多运动  | Mm, the doctor did say I needed to get more exercise. |
| 他的意思是让你多走走吧  | I think he meant walks around the block. |
| 没  他对我使了眼色  | No, he winked at me, |
| 然后下半身这么扭动了几下...  | and did this little rotation with his hips, like... |
| 我们这周末有任何安排吗  | Hey, we got any plans this weekend? |
| 我想我们能开始弄个小菜园  | I thought maybe we could get started on the vegetable garden, |
| 然后周日要上教堂嘛  | and then, of course, church on Sunday. |
| 听起来可有趣了  | Yeah, that does sound fun, |
| 但你觉得我带着小乔治  | but what if, instead, I was to go up to Bethy Creek |
| 去克罗斯溪怎么样  | with Georgie and do some fishing? |
| 这话你打算拖到什么时候才跟我说  | How long you been waiting to spring that on me? |
| 当然是要等到我"扭动"完屁股啊  | Well, not till I was done rotating my hips. |
| 你坏死了  | You're awful. |
| 所以怎么样  | So what do you say? |
| 那谢尔顿呢  | What about Sheldon? |
| 他怎么样  | What about him? |
| 乔治  | George. |
| 你不能总不带他啊  | You can't always leave him out. |
| 我没有不带他啊  | I'm not leaving him out. |
| 你也知道他对钓鱼的态度  | You know how he is about fishing. |
| 弄走它  弄走它  | Get it away, get it away! |
| 冷静  它就是个小东西而已  | Calm down, it's an itty-bitty thing. |
| 不  我才是小东西好吗  | No, I'm an itty-bitty thing! |
| 谁说你一定得带他去钓鱼  | Who says you have to take him fishing? |
| 找别的事跟他做嘛  | Find something else to do with him. |
| 他会喜欢的事  | Something he'd like. |
| 那我们能干嘛  整个周末坐在那里沉思吗  | What are we gonna do? Spend the weekend sitting around, thinking? |
| 乔治  | George. |
| 你得做出努力啊  | You have to make an effort. |
| 不跟自己父亲花时间共处的小男孩  | Young boys who don't spend time with their daddies |
| 长大后会变成怪胎  | grow up to be oddballs. |
| 亲爱的  我不想戳破现实  但这胎已经很怪了  | Honey, I hate to tell you, but that ball is already pretty odd. |
| 求求你嘛  | Please. |
| 好啦好啦  | Okay, fine. |
| 我再去跟他谈谈  想个事情做  | I'll talk to him. We'll think of something. |
| 那就好  | Good. |
| 谢谢你  | Thank you. |
| 笑什么呢  | What? |
| 我只是想起来以前带他去露营  | I was just remembering when I took him camping. |
| 有蛾子  蛾子  | Moth! Moth! |
| 谢尔顿  只是只蝴蝶而已  | Sheldon, it's just a butterfly. |
| 这就有比较好吗  | How is that any better? |
| 蝴蝶  蝴蝶  | Butterfly, butterfly! |

| 小兄弟  | Hey, pal. |
| 在玩你的火箭吗  | Playing with your rockets? |
| 我是在计算弹道系数  | I'm trying to calculate ballistic coefficients. |
| 这也很有趣  | Well, that's fun, too. |
| 是这样的  我这周末不用工作  | Listen, I don't have to work this weekend; |
| 我在想你有没有兴趣一起做点什么  | I was wondering if you wanted to do something together. |
| 比如呢  | Like what? |
| 你想做什么都行  | Whatever you want. |
| 我的空气净化机需要换滤网了  | Well, the filter on my air purifier needs to be changed. |
| 一起去一趟百货公司怎么样  | How about a trip to Sears? |
| 我想的是那种活动性更强的事情  | Yeah, I was thinking along the lines of something a little more active. |
| 比如去年  | Like last year, |
| 我们去钓鱼  | we went fishing... |
| 妈  爸爸又想叫我去钓鱼  | Mom! Dad's trying to make me go fishing! |
| 没  没有  没那回事  | No, no, it's okay. |
| 我们没有要去钓鱼  | We're not going fishing. |
| 好的  那就好  | All right, good. |
| 不过说真的  | But seriously, |
| 钓鱼真的有那么糟吗  | was fishing really that bad? |
| 妈  爸又在想说服我  | Mom! Dad's trying to convince me |
| 钓鱼没那么糟糕  | that fishing wasn't that bad! |
| 别这样  | Shh. Come on! |
| 忘了我说的跟钓鱼有关的话  | Forget I said anything about fishing. |
| 你就想一想  | Just think about it, |
| 我们就做你有兴趣的事情  | and we'll do whatever you want. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 这周末有个航天飞机要发射  | There is the launching of the space shuttle this weekend. |
| 航天飞机  | Space shuttle? |
| 它们不都是在佛罗里达发射的吗  | Don't they do those out of Florida? |
| 是啊  在卡纳维拉尔角  | Yes. Cape Canaveral. |
| 谢尔顿  去得开车12到15小时呢  | Sheldon, that's-that's like a 12, 15 hour drive. |
| 我懂了  没关系  | I understand. Never mind. |
| 这样吧  我们去吧  | You know what? Let's do it. |
| 会很有意思的  | It'll be fun. |
| 三个库珀家男儿的冒险  | The three Cooper boys on a little adventure. |
| 不错吧  | Sound good? |
| 不错  | Sounds good. |
| 我的计划终于要实现了  | My plan was coming together. |
| 我只需要登上航天飞机  | I just needed to get on the shuttle |
| 我就可以逃离这个可笑的星球了  | so I could finally escape this ridiculous planet. |
| 剧透一下  我还在这星球  | Spoiler alert, I'm still here. |
| 谢尔顿  小乔治与我  | So, Sheldon, me and Georgie |
| 这周末要来一趟公路旅行  | are gonna take a little road trip this weekend, |
| 去看航天飞机升空  | see the shuttle launch. |
| 看来我没有什么话语权  | Looks like I don't get a vote in this. |
| 很好  你很上道  | Oh, good, you're catching on. |
| 不知道能不能见到宇航员  | I wonder if we'll get to meet an astronaut. |
| 我记得我还是少女那会儿  | I remember when I was a teenager, |
| 当年超迷恋宇航员小约翰·格伦  | I had the biggest crush on John Glenn. |
| 我当时愿意把"那个"都给她  | I would've given it up for him no problem. |
| -妈  -给他什么  | - Mom. - Given what up? |
| 她的零用钱  吃你的饭  | Her allowance. Just eat. |
| 你们要去多久  | So how long are you gonna be gone? |
| 我们星期六一大早就出发  | Oh, we'll leave first thing Saturday morning, |
| 在汽车旅馆住一晚  | stay the night in a motel, |
| 然后周日一大早就看升空  | and see the launch bright and early on Sunday. |
| 真不敢相信我们要去看  | I can't believe we're going to see |
| 一个货真价实的航天器  | an actual working spacecraft. |
| 看看他多开心  | Look how happy he is. |
| 你真棒  | Good job. |
| 为什么我不能去  | How come I don't get to go? |
| 因为你我姥姥三个人要一起玩  | 'Cause you, me and Meemaw are gonna have our own fun. |
| 我们能去靶场射击吗  | Could we shoot guns at the gun range? |
| 你还太小不能去靶场  | Mm, you're too young to go to the gun range. |
| 姥姥就带我去过  | Meemaw took me. |
| 我们拉勾说好不泄密  你在干嘛  | We pinky swore. What are you doing? |
| 忘了  | Oh, yeah. |
| 别听我说的  | Don't listen to me. |
| 小孩子爱胡言乱语  | I don't know what I'm saying. |
| 我知道你喜欢一直开  | I know you like to just keep driving, |
| 直接开到目的地  但是你不能不管  | and get where you're going, but you can't ignore |
| -谢尔顿的如厕时间表  -我知道  | - his bathroom schedule. - I know. |
| 他早上第一件事就是要上小号  | He goes number one first thing in the morning, |
| 下午再一次  傍晚在一次  | then again in the afternoon, once more in the late afternoon, |
| 大概4点4点半  看他喝了多少果汁  | say 4:00, 4:30, depending on his juice intake, |
| 然后睡前再一小泡  | and then, a quick piddle before bedtime. |
| "一小泡"  懂了  | "Piddle." Got it. |
| 但大号就比较复杂了  | Now, number two's a little trickier. |
| 玛丽  放轻松  我能照顾好我儿子  | Mary? Relax. I can take care of my son. |
| 我知道  | I know. |
| 那就好  | Good. |
| 我只是想说  | I'm just saying, |
| 如果他不开心或紧张  | if he's upset or nervous, |
| 他就会大不出来  | he can get all clogged up. |
| 我不会让这事发生的  | I won't let that happen. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 好的  接下来来说食物  | Okay, let's talk about food. |
| 不需要  | No need to. |
| 他喜欢肉至少要煮到74度以上  | He likes his meat cooked to at least 165 degrees, |
| 除了鸡肉  鸡肉得82度  | except for chicken, which is 180. |
| 盘子里的食物必须分开放  | The different foods can't touch each other on the plate. |
| 只吃袋装的番茄酱与芥末酱  | Ketchup and mustard must come out of a packet. |
| 瓶装的不吃  | No bottles. |
| 那他对意大利面的问题呢  | What about his issues with spaghetti? |
| 这是陷阱题  | That's a trick question. |
| 他喜欢吃意大利面  | He likes spaghetti. |
| 好吧  我想你能搞定  | All right, I guess you got this. |
| 小乔治  | Georgie. |
| 起床啦  | Up and at 'em. |
| 米希  你的弟弟呢  | Missy, where's your brother? |
| 谁管他啊  | Who cares? |
| 谢尔顿  你在里面吗  | Sheldon, you in there? |
| 爸爸  | Dad! |
| 抱歉  小乔治  | Sorry, Georgie. |
| 怎么了  | What's going on? |
| 我找不到谢尔顿  | I can't find Sheldon. |
| 你说找不到他是什么意思  | What do you mean, you can't find him? |
| 就是说不知道他上哪去了  | I mean I don't know where he is. |
| 他肯定在家里哪里吧  | Well, he's got to be somewhere. |
| 或许他的时光机终于能用了  | Maybe he got that time machine to work. |
| 到底上哪去了  | Where the hell... |
| 乔治  | George. |
| 看来他已经准备好出发了  | I think he's ready to go. |
| -等等  小乔治  你的行李包呢  -不需要啊  | - Wait, Georgie. Where's your bag? - Don't need one. |
| 我的牙刷在这里呢  | Got my toothbrush right here. |
| 换洗衣物呢  | What about clothes? |
| 换洗的内裤呢  | A change of underwear? |
| 带了  | Got it. |
| 小乔治  你要出门两天呢  | Georgie, you're gonna be gone for two days. |
| 我可以反过来穿啊  | I'll turn them inside out. |
| -我要前座  -不不  | - Shotgun! - No, no. |
| 偶尔换你弟弟坐一次前座  | Let your brother sit up front for a change. |
| 我其实比较想坐后座  | I actually prefer sitting in the back. |
| 比较安全  | It's safer. |
| 来嘛  去前座陪你爸爸  | Oh, come on, sit up front with your daddy. |
| 他都不够时间跟你相处  | He doesn't get to spend enough time with you. |
| 我先喊了要前座  | I called shotgun. |
| 乔治  | George. |
| 我们掷硬币决定  | We'll flip a coin. |
| 好了吧  小乔治  选边  | All right? Georgie, call it. |
| 人头  | Heads. |
| 是字  | Tails. |
| -可恶  -谢尔顿  你赢了  | - Dang it. - Sheldon, you won. |
| 你坐前座  | You get to ride up front. |
| 不能三战两胜吗  | Can't we do two out of three? |
| 你赢了  上车  | You won. Get in the car. |
| 这年头先喊坐前座没意义了吗  | What's the point in calling shotgun? |
| 你是个好爸爸  | You're a good dad. |
| 等他俩都活过周日再叫我好爸爸吧  | If I don't kill one of them before Sunday, I'm a good dad. |
| 玩得愉快  | Have fun. |
| 爱你们  | Love you guys. |
| 再见啦  小心开车  | Bye! Drive safe! |
| 这是个好主意  这真是个好主意  | Oh, this was a good idea, this was a good idea, |
| 是个好主意  | this was a good idea. |
| 这是个好主意  | This was a good idea. |
| 是不是很兴奋啊  | Isn't this exciting? |
| 只有我们三个姑娘  家里没有臭男生  | It's just us girls, no boys in the house. |
| 感觉家里已经香了一点呢  | The place already smells better. |
| 我们要一起做什么呢  | So what are we gonna do? |
| 你有没有兴趣  | How would you like |
| 去美容院来个全套美容  | to go to the beauty salon and get all done up? |
| 我能像女星辛蒂·罗波一样染橙发吗  | Can I have orange hair like Cyndi Lauper? |
| 门都没有  | I don't think so. |
| 姥姥就有蓝头发的朋友  | Meemaw has friends with blue hair. |
| 的确是啊  | She's right. |
| 我还没到那一步  | I haven't gone there yet, |
| 但过了某个年龄  不染不行啊  | but after a certain age, it's mandatory. |
| 你别想给头发染色  | Your hair's not changing color. |
| 抱歉啦孩子  | Sorry, kiddo. |
| 你妈最无聊了  | Your mom is no fun. |
| 不好意思  我很有趣好吗  | Excuse me, I'm fun. |
| 那我可以染头发吗  | So I can color my hair? |
| 想都别想  | Not a chance. |
| 但我可有趣了  | But I'm very much fun. |
| 你想自欺就随你吧  | Whatever you need to believe. |
| 希特勒元首  | Mein Fuhrer. |
| 爸爸  | Dad? |
| 什么事  | Yeah? |
| 你有兴趣进行一场对话吗  | Would you like to have a conversation? |
| 好啊  当然啦  | Yeah. Sure. Absolutely. |
| 好的  你想聊什么  | All right, what would you like to talk about? |
| 我想想  | Um, well, let's see. |
| 你有没有想过长大以后  | Uh... have you given much thought to what you want to be |
| 要干哪一行  | when you grow up? |
| 想过  | I have. |
| 很好  | Great. |
| 所以是什么呢  | And what would that be? |
| 很可能是科学家  | Oh. Most likely a scientist. |
| 除非我留在德州  那可能是当养牛大亨  | Unless I stay in Texas, then I'm thinking cattle baron. |
| 养牛大亨吗  | Cattle baron? |
| 前提是我不需要碰到牛  | Assuming I don't have to touch the cows. |
| 这还用说  | Goes without saying. |
| 你从小就想成为橄榄球教练吗  | Did you always want to be a football coach? |
| 我一直想打橄榄球  | Well, I always wanted to play. |
| 至少在我受伤前都是  | At least till I got hurt. |
| 你打得好吗  | Were you a good player? |
| 不怎么样  | Eh, not really. |
| 我只是比其他孩子块头大  | I was just bigger than the other kids. |
| 所以你的大块头弥补了你的平庸  | So you compensated for mediocrity by being large. |
| 我想是吧  | I guess. |
| 这在牛身上也同样适用  | That works for cattle as well. |
| 谢谢你指出这点  | Oh, well, thanks for pointing that out. |
| 不客气  | You're welcome. |
| 你们最好打开窗户  | You might want to open a window. |
| 要死了  | Oh, boy. |
| 我的头好热  | My head is so hot. |
| 她真有意思  | She is such a hoot. |
| -你还好吧  -没事  | - You okay? - Fine. |
| 那好吧  别告诉我了  | Okay, don't tell me. |
| 超热  | So hot... |
| 我不喜欢你把我塑造成坏人  | I don't like you making me out to be the bad guy |
| 就因为我不让我女儿随心所欲  | just 'cause I won't let my daughter do whatever she wants. |
| 我以前也给了你很多自由  | I gave you a lot of freedom, |
| 你现在不也挺好  | you turned out okay. |
| 你才没有给我自由  | You didn't give me freedom. |
| 你总是不在家  | You were never around. |
| 是吗  | Is that so? |
| 我保证  我给莎琳和爱德华做的晚饭  | I guarantee I made supper for Charlene and Edward |
| 比你做的还多  | more times than you ever did. |
| 基本上是我养大了他们  | I basically raised 'em. |
| 你以为我在外面跳舞享乐吗  | You think I was out dancing? |
| 我是在外面打两份工  | I was out working two jobs so your daddy could |
| 结果你爸经营快照小铺  把所有钱都赔了个精光  | lose all our money on that damn chain of Fotomats! |
| 美国连锁小店  提供冲晒照片服务  | 通常开在郊区超市停车场或商业区 |
| 那个小摊子每次来台风就被吹倒  | It wasn't Daddy's fault that those little things blew over |
| 又不是爸的错  | every time there was a storm. |
| 说真的  我快融化了  | Seriously, I'm melting. |
| 死犰狳  | Dead armadillo. |
| 我得三分  | That's three for me. |
| 这个开车游戏烂透了  | This is a terrible driving game. |
| 如果它还在抽搐  能算路毙动物吗  | Is it roadkill if it's still twitchin'? |
| 既死又活  就像薛定谔的猫  | Huh, both alive and dead, just like Schrodinger's cat. |
| 我都不知道他有养猫  | I didn't know he had a cat. |
| 你听说过薛定谔吗  | You've heard of Schrodinger? |
| 当然了  就是《查理·布朗》里  | Sure. It's the kid from Charlie Brown |
| 其实是叫史洛德    | 和查理·布朗与露茜同为《花生漫画》里的角色 |
| 弹钢琴的那个小孩  | who plays the piano. |
| 露茜暗恋他  | Lucy's got a crush on him. |
| 薛定谔的猫是项思想实验  | Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment. |
| 一只猫被关在盒子里  接触放射性物质  | A cat in a box is exposed to poison, |
| 在盒子打开前  猫的状态是既生又死  | and is both alive and dead until it is observed. |
| 那只猫名叫薛定谔吗  | So the cat's name is Schrodinger? |
| 不是  | No. |
| 那它叫什么  | Well, what's its name? |
| 它的名字不重要  | Its name doesn't matter. |
| 如果猫死了就重要了  | It does if the cat was dead. |
| 不然它的墓碑上要刻什么名字  | Otherwise, what are you gonna put on his tombstone? |
| 这猫估计也不会有墓碑  | Not likely the cat's getting a tombstone. |
| 要是葬在宠物墓地里就会有的  | It would in a pet cemetery. |
| 好吧  猫的名字叫白手套  | Fine, the cat's name is Mittens. |
| 因为它有奶白色的小爪子吗  | Because he has little white feet? |
| 是啊  | Sure. |
| 那在这项思想实验里  | So, in this thought experiment, |
| 你认为小奶猫是生是死呢  | do you think Mittens is dead or alive? |
| 在打开盒子前  无法确定  | There's no way of saying until you open the box. |
| 别卖关子嘛  | Oh, come on. |
| 乐观来说  我选择相信它还活着  | Optimistically, I would choose to believe he's alive. |
| 好棒  | Yes! |
| 谢天谢地  | Oh, thank goodness. |
| 死乌鸦  | Oh, dead crow. |
| 这只毫无疑问是死透了  | There ain't no doubt about that one. |
| 这里的马桶为了我的安全  已经消毒过了  | The toilet was sanitized for my protection. |
| 我超爱这地方  | I love this place. |
| 爸爸  我们能去爬虫世界玩吗  | Dad, can we go to Reptile World? |
| 不行  | No. |
| 那里有超大条的蛇  能一口吞掉整只鸡  | They a got snake so big it can eat a whole chicken. |
| 这样的话  不行  | Oh, well, in that case, no. |
| -讨厌  -我们睡觉吧  | - Aw. - Let's get some sleep. |
| 我们明天得早起  才能赶到卡纳维拉尔角  | We got to get up early if we're gonna get to Cape Canaveral |
| 看航天飞机起飞  | in time for liftoff. |
| 我太兴奋了  不知道能不能睡着  | I'm so excited, I don't know if I can. |
| 小家伙  你得努力试试  好吗  | Well, buddy, you're gonna have to try, all right? |
| 你俩一起睡那张床  我睡这张  | You two share that bed, I'll take this one. |
| -不行  -没门  | - No. - Nuh-uh. |
| 别这样  小伙子们  我块头最大  | Come on, fellas, I'm the biggest. |
| 我自己睡一张床才合理  | It makes sense that I get a bed to myself. |
| -不行  -没门  | - No. - Nuh-uh. |
| 那我们掷硬币决定  小乔治选边  | We'll flip for it. Georgie, call it. |
| 人头  | Heads. |
| 你今天不走运啊  | Not your day. |
| 可恶  | Dang it. |
| -那看起来是人头啊  -去刷你的牙  | - That looked like heads. - Go brush your teeth. |
| 这样真的有用吗  | This really works? |
| 你的头发到明天还会是一样美美的  | Your hair will look just as pretty tomorrow. |
| 睡吧  我给你盖被子  | Now, come on, let's tuck you in. |
| 我很庆幸我没染橘色头发  | I'm glad I don't have orange hair. |
| 我也是  宝贝  | Me, too, baby. |
| 我想像麦当娜一样  | I want to be more like Madonna. |
| 你想气死我吗  | Are you trying to kill me? |
| 如果是  那你快成功了  | 'Cause if you are, good job. |
| 她为什么只像处女啊  | Why is she only like a virgin? |
| 晚安  | Good night! |
| 你准备好继续跟我谈了吗  | You ready to finish our conversation? |
| 没什么好谈的  | There's nothing to finish. |
| 我把自己抚养成人  就像森林泰山一样  | I raised myself like a jungle child. |
| 说完了  | End of story. |
| 别那么夸张好吗  | Oh, stop being so dramatic. |
| 你以为我不难受吗  | You think I didn't feel bad |
| 我也想多陪在你们身边啊  | not being around more than I wanted to be? |
| 你真难受吗  | Did you? |
| 有一点吧  | A little bit. |
| 我在逗你呢  我当然难受了  | I'm teasing, come on. Of course I did. |
| 不然我干嘛求你和乔治  | Why else would I have begged you and George |
| 搬回梅德福  | to move back to Medford? |
| 你是为了和外孙们待在一起  | So you could be with your grandchildren. |
| 还有你  | And you. |
| -真的吗  -是啊  | - Really? - Yeah. |
| 我的孩子里就只有你还肯跟我说话了  | You're the only one of my children still talking to me. |
| 真是毫不意外  | No surprise there. |
| 再说了  你把自己养得比我养得还好  | Besides, you raised yourself better than I ever could. |
| 你真这么想吗  | You actually believe that? |
| 不  但要是你相信了就能原谅我了   | No, but it would help my cause if you did. |
| 你头发看起来很美  | Your hair looks pretty. |
| 够了  | Enough. |
| 爸爸  | Dad? |
| 爸爸  | Dad? |
| 爸爸  | Dad? |
| 爸爸  | Dad. |
| 干什么  | What? |
| 乔治一直踢我  | Georgie keeps kicking me. |
| 踢回去  | Kick him back. |
| 我不想碰到他  | I'd rather not touch him. |
| 你想和我一起睡吗  | You want to sleep with me? |
| 想  谢谢  | Yes, thank you. |
| 好了  | Yeah. |
| 位置够吗  | Got enough room? |
| 够了  | Yes. |
| 你散发出好多热气啊  | You throw off a lot of heat. |
| 抱歉  | Sorry. |
| 没事  挺舒服的  | That's all right. It's kind of nice. |
| 下雨了他们还发射航天飞机吗  | Do they launch those shuttles in the rain? |
| 小雨应该没问题  | I think a light rain's okay. |
| 糟了  | Oh, no. |
| 会雨过天晴的  | It'll pass. |
| 先睡觉吧  | Just get some sleep. |
| 雨没过天未晴  | It didn't pass. |
| 谢尔顿  我也很遗憾  | Sheldon, I'm real sorry. |
| 我跟你说个秘密好吗  | Can I tell you a secret? |
| 我一直不知道闪电是如何产生的  | I never understood how lightning works. |
| 你的高中没教过吗  | Didn't they teach you that in high school? |
| 应该有吧  | They probably did, |
| 但我那时打橄榄球  头整天撞来撞去  | but I got hit in the head a lot playing football. |
| 你能解释给我听吗  | Would you explain it to me? |
| 当正负电荷积累得够多  | Well, when positive and negative charges grow large enough, |
| 云内就会产生巨大的闪光  | a giant spark occurs in the cloud. |
| 听起来挺酷啊  那打雷是怎么回事  | Ah, that-that's pretty cool. What causes the thunder? |
| 是粒子被加热到5500摄氏度时产生的冲击波  | It's a shock wave from particles heated to 10,000 degrees. |
| 真有趣  | Interesting. |
| 你想知道什么才真的有趣吗  | You want to know what's really interesting? |
| 亚里士多德认为打雷的响声  | Aristotle thought that the sound of thunder |
| 是由两朵云碰撞产生的  | was due to a collision between two clouds. |
| 他认为云朵在排出空气  | He believed the clouds were expelling air, |
| 类似火堆上的木头发出噼啪声  | in the way a log on a fire crackles... |
| 直到很多年后  我才意识到  | I didn't realize until years later |
| 我爸爸问我关于闪电和打雷的问题  | that my father was only asking questions |
| 只是为了让我振作起来  | about lightning and thunder to cheer me up. |
| 其实呢  他经常装傻扮蠢  | In fact, he would often pretend to be dumb |
