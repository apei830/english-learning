| 你在干嘛  | What are you doing? |
| 我听说可以打个洞  | I heard you could punch a hole in these |
| 就能让它变成双面的  | and make them double-sided. |
| 这样你就有双倍储存空间吗  | Then it would have more storage? |
| 是啊  可是我没付双面软盘的钱啊  | Yes, but I didn't pay for a double-sided floppy disk. |
| 那又如何  | So? |
| 所以这是个道德难题啊  | So it's an ethical dilemma. |
| 我们下一节课得在更衣室洗澡  | We have to take a shower in the locker room next period, |
| 你现在居然有心情担心这个  | and that's what you're worried about? |
| 我在裤子里穿好了泳裤  | Actually, I have a bathing suit under my pants. |
| 那女孩拿了一本地质统计学的书  | That girl just took a book on geostatistics. |
| 那又如何  | Yeah, so? |
| 那并不是任何科学课要求阅读的读物  | That's not required reading for any science course. |
| 或许她是想拿去拍死蜘蛛呢  | Maybe she wants to squash a spider with it. |
| 不是  你看  她在读  | No, look, she's reading it. |
| 这个神秘的女人是谁啊  | Who is this mystery woman? |
| 我们应该邀请她来跟我们一起吃饭吗  | Should we invite her to have lunch with us? |
| 不知道啊  至今为止一直只有我俩  | I don't know. So far, it's just been you and me, |
| 我们能确定合得来  | and we know that works. |
| 你真的想要冒合不来的风险吗  | Do we really want to mess with success? |
| 你可以把这个当做是个实验  | We could think of it as an experiment. |
| 你还真是懂我的弱点啊  | Oh, you do know how to push my buttons. |
| 好啦  去问她  | All right, go ask her. |
| 为什么是我去  | Why me? |
| 你的睾酮缺乏令你在女性眼中很可爱  | Your lack of testosterone makes you adorable to women. |
| 这我无从反驳  | I can't argue with that. |
| 你好  | Hello. |
| 你好啊  | Hello. |
| 我叫谢尔顿  | My name is Sheldon. |
| 我知道你叫谢尔顿·库珀  | Yeah, you're Sheldon Cooper. |
| 你认识我吗  | You know who I am? |
| 整个高中只有一个9岁的人  | Well, there's only one nine-year-old in high school, |
| 而你还有没换完的乳牙  | and you still have your baby teeth. |
| 她认识我  情况很顺利  | She knows who I am. It's going well. |
| 找我有什么事  | What do you want? |
| 你愿意跟我与我朋友一起共进午餐吗  | Would you like to have lunch with me and my friend? |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 为什么不呢  | Why else? |
| 这样我们才能热烈地聊地质统计学啊  | So we can have a spirited conversation about geostatistics. |
| 你真的跟大家说的一样聪明啊  | You really are as smart as everybody says. |
| 我的牙齿虽小  但我的前额皮质超巨大  | My teeth are small, but my prefrontal cortex is enormous. |

| 随着莉比的加入  | The addition of Libby brought |
| 我们午餐期间的聊天深度也有所提升  | a level of sophistication to our lunchtime discussion. |
| 她妈妈还为她多带了起司条  | Her mom also packed extra string cheese, |
| 这广为人知的社交润滑剂  | which is a well-known social lubricant. |
| 你以后要当地质学家  | You're gonna be a geologist. |
| 太有意思了  | That's fascinating. |
| 你为什么选这领域呢  | Why'd you choose that? |
| 在我小时候  我的爷爷奶奶带我去  | When I was a little girl, my grandparents took me |
| 卡尔斯巴德洞窟国家公园时迷上了  | to Carlsbad Caverns, and I was hooked. |
| 探索洞窟  太酷了  | Exploring caves, that is super cool. |
| 我不同意  黑暗又封闭的空间令我恐惧  | Disagree. Dark, enclosed spaces are terrifying. |
| 我头套进衣服时都会被吓到  | I get scared putting on a sweatshirt. |
| 我看过那场面  | Hmm. ‭I've seen it. |
| 挺有娱乐效果  | Pretty entertaining. |
| 你想好上大学要选什么专业了吗  | Do you know what you're going to major in in college? |
| 我倾向选量子色动力学  但谁知道呢  | I'm leaning towards quantum chromodynamics, but who knows? |
| 要我几年前回答  我会答玩具小火车  | A few years ago, I would've said choo-choo trains. |
| 那你呢  | What about you? |
| 当然是地质学  | Oh, geology for sure. |
| 真的吗  | Really? |
| 你什么时候决定的  | When did you decide that? |
| 很久以前啊  吃你的苹果片  | A long time ago. Eat your apple slices. |
| 我们每天都在图书馆用餐  | So we eat in the library every day. |
| 欢迎你加入我们  | You're welcome to join us. |
| 比在食堂吃好多了  | It's much better than the cafeteria. |
| 又安静  又不太会有人丢食物到我们身上  | It's quiet, and a lot less food gets thrown at us. |
| 好啊  或许我明天再来找你们大伙儿  | Yeah. Maybe I'll see y'all tomorrow. |
| 好  | Right. |
| 大伙儿有机会明天见  | Maybe y'all will. |
| 莉比  再见啦  | Bye, Libby. |
| 还"大伙儿"呢  | "Y'all"? |
| 我是在试图同化  | I'm assimilating. |
| 你闭嘴  | Shut up. |
| 今天学校如何啊  | So how was school today? |
| 谢尔顿交了女朋友  | Sheldon's got a girlfriend. |
| -什么  -你乱说  | - What? - That's not true. |
| 是真的  我看到他在学校跟那女孩说话了  | Oh, yes, it is. I seen him talking to her at school. |
| 谢尔顿·李·库珀  你个小色胚  | Sheldon Lee Cooper, you dog. |
| 她可爱吗  | Is she cute? |
| 跟什么东西比  | Compared to what? |
| 她读几年级  | What grade is she in? |
| 11年级  | Eleventh. |
| 还是比你大的御姐啊  | An older woman. |
| 赞啊  | Nice. |
| 几乎所有人都比我大啊  | Most everybody's older than me. |
| 这有什么好赞的  | Why is that nice? |
| 所以你觉得如何  乔治  | So what do you think, George? |
| 是时候跟他"聊聊"了吗  | Is it time to have "The talk" with him? |
| 聊什么  | What talk? |
| 不聊  没人要聊  | No talk. Nobody's talking. |
| 如果"聊聊"是指有关人类繁衍的事情  | If "The talk" Is in regards to human reproduction, |
| 我已经知道是怎么个流程了  | I already understand how that works. |
| 你怎么会知道这些  | How do you know that? |
| 我告诉他的  | I told him. |
| 我的老天啊  | Oh, Lord. |
| 所以  我们的小圈子  | And so, our little social circle |
| 从两个人变成了三个人  | grew from two to three. |
| 一个早期的我能吸引所有人到我身边的例子  | An early example of how people are just drawn to me. |
| 你的意思是说  如果没有地质学  | Are you saying that without geology, |
| 世界上就不会有进化论吗  | there'd be no theory of evolution? |
| 地质学家查尔斯·莱尔教导达尔文  | Charles Lyell taught Charles Darwin |
| 地球比我们所有人认为的还要古老许多  | the Earth was much, much older than anyone thought, |
| 这给了达尔文勇气去发现  | which gave Darwin the courage to figure out |
| 所有的生物是在亿年多的时间里进化而来  | all species evolved over billions of years. |
| 这很不错  我可以用这个点  | That's good. I can use that |
| 去让我主日学校的牧师难堪  | to humiliate my pastor at Sunday school. |
| 我不知道哪个比较美  | I don't know what's more beautiful, |
| 是你美丽的大脑还是双眸  | your mind or your eyes. |
| 丹  别这样  | Tam, please. |
| 我们在吃饭呢  | We're eating. |
| 你知道暗中监视小孩很变态吧  | You know spying on kids is creepy. |
| 我不是在暗中监视小孩  是在监视你弟弟  | I wasn't spying on kids, I was s-spying on your brother. |
| 那你为什么不直接进去看  | Why won't you just go inside? |
| 直接进去就不是暗中监视了吧  | Well, then, it wouldn't be spying, now would it? |
| 你惊讶什么  | Oh, what? |
| 你没说她是黑人啊  | You didn't mention she was black. |
| 我应该提吗  | Was I supposed to? |
| 不用  当然不需要啊  | No, 'course not. |
| 那你说这个干嘛  | Then why bring it up? |
| 只是跟我预想中的不一样嘛  | It just wasn't what I was expecting. |
| 那你本来预想中的是什么样的  | What were you expecting? |
| 这学校很大  | It's a big school. |
| 你为什么一定要在这里  | Why are you right here? |
| 图书管里有人权斗士马丁·路德·金的书  | They've got some books in there about Martin Luther King. |
| 或许你该进去读一读  | Maybe you should go read one. |
| 早安  | Morning. |
| 所以为什么人们花了那么久的时间  | So why did it take people so long |
| 才愿意相信大陆漂移说呢  | to believe in continental drift, |
| 很明显能看出非洲跟南美洲  | when it's obvious that Africa and South America |
| -像拼图一样能吻合啊  -才没有呢  | - fit together like a puzzle? - No, they don't. |
| 人们不理解大陆漂移说  | People didn't understand continental drift |
| 是因为他们不懂海底扩张学说  | because they didn't understand seafloor spreading. |
| 怎么了  | What? |
| 你的智慧  | I'm both threatened |
| 令我受到威胁又为之折服  | and delighted by your brain. |
| 我只有为之折服  | I'm just delighted by it. |
| 还真能合上  | They do fit. |
| 这太神奇了吧  | That's nuts. |
| 地质学家喜欢在生活中让自己"沉淀"下来  | "Geologists lead a sedimentary lifestyle." |
| 莉比  你这双关有意思  | Libby, that is a good one. |
| 你敢相信他这个样子吗  | Can you believe what's going on with him? |
| 对啊  | I know. |
| 他都快跟那女孩聊了一个小时电话了  | He's been on the phone with that girl for almost an hour. |
| 谢尔顿交了女朋友  | Sheldon's got a girlfriend. |
| 谁能想到有这可能  | What are the odds? |
| 那女孩才不是女朋友  | She's not a girlfriend, |
| 两个人只是精神交流  | it's more of a mental rapport. |
| 一切都是这么开始的  | That's where it starts. |
| 我就是用我超凡的智慧赢得你心  | I did win you over with my superior intellect. |
| 明明是你的机车  你自己清楚  | It was your motorcycle and you know it. |
| 幸好她不是被你的猛男体格所迷惑  | Good thing it wasn't your masculine physique, |
| 因为那早已一去不复返了  | because that is long gone. |
| 不然你觉得我留着那机车的原因是什么  | Why do you think I kept the motorcycle? |
| 为什么他可以煲电话粥而我不行  | How come he gets to tie up the phone and I can't? |
| 因为发生在他身上的事叫神迹  | Because what is happening in there is called a miracle, |
| 而敬畏神的信徒是不会去阻止神迹的  | and God-fearing people do not get in the way of those. |
| 小乔治  | Hey, Georgie, |
| 如果哪天你能找到女朋友  | if you ever find a girlfriend, |
| 或许你能跟你弟弟他们四人约会啊  | maybe you can go on a double date with your brother. |
| 那女孩不是他女朋友  | She's not his girlfriend. |
| 我也交得到啊  | And I can find one... |
| 我只是没在找女朋友而已  | I'm just not looking. |
| 是啊  那的确是地质学的笑话  | Yes, that was a geology joke. |
| 或许我们应该在《体育画报泳装特辑》  | We gotta get that Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue |
| 毁了他人生之前  先把它收走  | away from him before he's ruined forever. |
| 莉比莉比莉比啊  | Oh, Libby, Libby, Libby. |
| 到底发生什么了  | What is happening? |
| 当时所发生的事呢  | What was happening was, |
| 也发生在许多男性身上  | like many men before me, |
| 我被有着异域风情的地质学所迷惑了  | I was being seduced by the exotic world of geology. |
| 我们在附近的山涧里寻找着玻陨石  | We searched for tektites in a nearby ravine. |
| 玻陨石就是天然玻璃  | Tektites are natural glass |
| 是在陨石撞击后形成的  | formed during meteorite impacts. |
| 它们也与浣熊粪便十分相似  | They also bear a close resemblance to raccoon feces, |
| 所以我聪明地开始了"不碰玻陨石"政策  | so I wisely adopted a "No touching tektites" policy. |
| 这叫完全解理[完美乳沟]  | It's called perfect cleavage |
| 当石膏分离地如此干净时的称呼  | when gypsum separates this cleanly. |
| 我当时好为丹感到骄傲  | I was so proud of Tam |
| 他没有开幼稚的乳沟玩笑  | for not making an immature cleavage joke. |
| 快看我  我在摸乳沟  | Look at me, I'm touching cleavage. |
| 他说完那感觉就消失了  | Until he made one. |
| 而晶洞玉石就像是大自然的皮纳塔  | And, like Mother Nature's pinata, |
| 皮纳塔是一种装满糖果或玩具的纸糊容器  | 通常在生日会上悬挂并让人击打到掉出奖品 |
| 它的里面也含有秘密的惊喜  | geodes contained a secret surprise inside. |
| 而且你不用忍受  | But you didn't have to suffer |
| 参加生日派对的痛苦就能享受惊喜  | through a birthday party to enjoy it. |
| 怎么样了  | How's it going? |
| 我想我找出问题所在了  | Well, I think I figured out the problem. |
| 问题在哪  | What is it? |
| 我对修机械一窍不通  | I'm a terrible mechanic. |
| -怎么啦  -这个嘛  | - What's up? ‭- Well, |
| 谢尔顿最近花了不少时间  | Sheldon's been spending quite a bit of time |
| 跟那叫莉比的女孩混在一起  | with this Libby girl, lately. |
| 所以呢  | Yeah, so? |
| 他还那么小  | So isn't he a little young |
| 交青少年的朋友真的好吗  | to be hanging with teenagers? |
| 他只是身体还小  | Oh, he's only young on the outside. |
| 他心里就是个老头  | Inside, he's an old man. |
| 我是说认真的  | I'm being serious. |
| 我也是啊  | So am I. |
| 再给他别上领结  他外表也老了  | And with that bowtie, he's old on the outside, too. |
| 我不该来问你的  | Sorry I bothered. |
| 等一下  | Hang on. |
| 我们送他去念高中时  | What did you think was gonna happen |
| 你以为会怎么样  | when we sent him to high school? |
| 我不知道  他会学习新知识  | I don't know, that he'd learn stuff, |
| 然后回到家里  永远当我的小宝贝  | and then, come back home and be my baby forever. |
| 玛丽  这对他是好事  | Mare, it's good for him. |
| 再过两年他也许就要上大学了  到时怎么办  | He may start college in a couple years, what happens then? |
| 我瞬间想到的答案是  我跟他住一间宿舍  | Off the top of my head, he and I share a dorm room. |
| 要不是觉得你真可能这么做  这话还挺好笑的  | You know I'd laugh at that if I didn't kind of believe you. |
| 你在干嘛  | What are you doing? |
| 我想上厕所  但里面有时会不太文明  | I need to use the bathroom, but it can get uncivilized in there. |
| 现在里面有人吗  | Anyone in there now? |
| 我不知道  我害怕找出答案  | I don't know. I was afraid to find out. |
| 厕所有人吗  | Anybody in here? |
| 去吧  | Go ahead. |
| 我守在外面  | I'll stand guard. |
| 我之前的人生你都跑哪儿去了  | Where have you been all my life? |
| 想都别想  | I don't think so. |
| 我要尿尿  | I gotta pee. |
| 那是你的问题  一边儿去  | That's your problem. Keep moving. |
| -谢谢你  -不客气  | - Thank you. - ‭Happy to help. |
| 1点45分时你能来站岗吗  | Is there any chance you'd be available to stand guard at 1:45? |
| 你还有上厕所的时间表吗  | You have a bathroom schedule? |
| 你没有吗  | You don't? |
| 回见  | See you later. |
| 那些说抓住一个男人  | Whoever said the quickest way to a man's heart |
| 要先抓住他的胃的人  | is through his stomach |
| 没考虑过自己的小膀胱  | did not consider his tiny bladder. |
| 我觉得至今取得最好的航天飞机名是"探索号"  | I think the best space shuttle name so far is Discovery. |
| 那"挑战者号"呢  | What about Challenger? |
| -太咄咄逼人  -"亚特兰蒂斯号"呢  | - Too in-your-face. - Atlantis? |
| 一个浮不起来的虚构岛屿  | A fictional island that couldn't stay afloat? |
| 烂得很彻底  | I don't think so. |
| -还有"企业号"啊  -是没错  | - There's the Enterprise. - ‭There is, |
| 《星际迷航》里也有这艘飞船  那才是它的家  | and it's on Star Trek, where it belongs. |
| 你知道吗  自然科学博物馆  | You know they're playing a space shuttle movie |
| 正在放一部航天飞机电影  | at the Museum of Natural Science. |
| -还是巨幕电影呢  -我也听说了  | - It's in IMAX. - I heard about that. |
| 屏幕好像会超级大  | The screen is supposed to be huge. |
| 那里还在举办地质学展览  | ‭They also have a great geology exhibit. |
| 可是博物馆在休斯顿  | Well, it's in Houston-- |
| -我们该怎么去呢  -我来开车  | - how are we gonna get there? - I'll drive. |
| 我很想跟你一起看电影  | Oh, I would love to see a movie with you. |
| 你不用先征得你父母同意吗  | Don't you need to ask your parents first? |
| -不用  谢尔顿  -但他们不会担心你在哪儿吗  | - No, Sheldon, I don't. - But won't they worry where you are? |
| 他们不会担心的  | They'll be fine. |
| 我加入  | Count me in. |
| 真庆幸你不是我儿子  | Glad you're not my son. |
| 现在他想跟他们去休斯顿看电影  | And now he wants to see a movie in Houston with them. |
| 为什么要去休斯顿  | Why Houston? |
| 我不知道  那边有"锯木"技术之类的  | I don't know, it's in MixMax or something. |
| 你意思是我得开车去休斯顿吗  | So you're saying I got to drive to Houston? |
| 不  那姑娘莉比开车  | No. This girl Libby's gonna drive. |
| 太好了  | Great. |
| 一点都不好  乔治  | It's not great, George. |
| 我可不希望我儿子坐上  | I don't want my little boy in some car |
| 由青少年驾驶的车  | with a teenager behind the wheel. |
| 所有高中生都开车  | All high school kids drive. |
| 是吗  反正我不喜欢  | Yeah? Well, I don't like it. |
| 我小的时候  | Would you let me get in a car |
| 你会让我坐陌生人的车吗  | with a stranger when I was young? |
| 没人约过你出去  所以没什么所谓  | Well, nobody ever asked you out, so it didn't really matter. |
| 我想跟你聊聊  | Hey. I want to talk to you. |
| 等等  我先把火车停入车站  | Hold on. Let me bring this into the station |
| 才不会让通勤乘客们失望  | so as not to disappoint my commuters. |
| 他们想回到家人身边  | They'd like to get home to their families. |
| 我考虑了很久  恐怕我不能允许你  | I gave it a lot of thought, and I'm afraid I can't allow you |
| 跟朋友开车去休斯顿  | to drive to Houston with your friends. |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 亲爱的  你还是个小孩子  | Well, honey, you're still a little boy. |
| 我觉得这样不对  | I don't think it's right. |
| 我不是小孩子了  我是高中生了  | I'm not a little boy. I'm a high school student. |
| 对不起  但我心意已决  | I'm sorry, I made up my mind. |
| 如果你真的很想看这部电影  | If you'd really like to see this movie, |
| 我愿意开车载你去  | I'm willing to drive you. |
| 或许我们可以和你朋友在那会合  | Maybe we could meet your friends there. |
| 我不想要我妈咪带我去  | I don't want my mommy to take me. |
| 那你就别想去了  | Well, then, you're not going. |
| 愤怒是一种丑陋的情绪  | Anger is an ugly emotion. |
| 狂怒更是如此  | Unbridled rage even more so. |
| 当我内心充满怒火时  | And when it bubbled up inside me, |
| 我用唯一懂得的方式来转化这种情绪  | I channeled it the only way I knew how. |
| 我仿佛着了魔一样  给房子彻底大扫除  | I cleaned the house like a man possessed. |
| 我听不见奥普拉说话了  | I can't hear Oprah! |
| 关我鸟事  | I don't care! |
| 谢尔顿  我得进去  | Sheldon, I need to get in there. |
| 去姥姥家上大号吧  | Poop at Meemaw's! |
| 你漏了这里没擦  怪胎  | You missed a spot, weirdo. |
| 我看到了  | I see it. |
| 他这副样子  我该这么办  | What am I supposed to do with this? |
| 在他的精力用光前  赶紧送去我家  | Send him over to my house before he runs out of gas. |
| 好吧  我们谈笔交易  | All right, I'll make a deal with you. |
| 我在听  | I'm listening. |
| 你可以跟朋友们去休斯顿  | You can go to Houston with your friends, |
| 但我想先见见这个女孩  | but I want to meet this girl first. |
| 合乎情理  | That's very reasonable. |
| 谢谢你  | Thank you. |
| 不客气  | You're welcome. |
| 你能把烘干纸拿下来吗  | Now, can you please reach the dryer sheets? |
| 我站上梯凳会头晕  | I get vertigo on the step stool. |
| 我常被人形容  | I've often been accused |
| 顽固不化  恣意妄为  | of being stubborn and willful, |
| 但有时这招很有用  | but sometimes it works like gangbusters. |
| 请进  | Please come in. |
| 请坐  | Have a seat. |
| 你家很漂亮  | You have a beautiful home. |
| -谢谢  -谢谢  | - Thank you. - ‭Thank you. |
| 希望你能原谅我  我就想见见  | I hope you'll forgive me, I just wanted to meet |
| 开车载我9岁儿子去休斯顿的人  | the person driving my nine-year-old son to Houston. |
| 我能理解  | I understand. |
| 我也是  | Me, too. |
| 我没跟你说话  丹  | I wasn't talking to you, Tam. |
| 还有  我想确定一下  | And I just wanted to make certain |
| 你没被开过罚单  | that you've had no traffic tickets |
| 更重要的是  没出过意外  | or, heaven forbid, accidents. |
| 没有  女士  我开车很小心  | No, ma'am. I'm a very safe driver. |
| -你完全不必担心  -很好  | - You've got nothing to worry about. ‭- Good. |
| 很好  你以前开车去过休斯顿吗  | Good. Have you made this trip before? |
| 开过几次  | A few times, yes. |
| 你吸大麻吗  | Mm-hmm. You smoke marijuana? |
| -妈妈  -不吸  女士  | - Mom! - ‭No, ma'am. |
| 勇敢说不[反大麻口号]  | Just say no. |
| 好吧  | Well... |
| 这让我很放心  | I find this very reassuring. |
| 我得承认  | I have to admit, |
| 我本来有些担忧  但是  | I had some trepidation, but... |
| 见过你之后  我感觉好多了  | having met you, I'm feeling a lot better. |
| 那就好  你没什么可担心的  库珀太太  | Good. You've got nothing to worry about, Mrs. Cooper. |
| 我有多年看顾小孩的经验  | I've been babysitting kids for years. |
| 看顾小孩  看顾小孩  | Babysitting... babysitting... |
| 看顾小孩  | Babysitting. |
| 看顾小孩  看顾小孩  | Babysitting... babysitting... |
| 我有多年看顾小孩的经验  | I've been babysitting kids for years. |
| 不好意思  | Excuse me. |
| 我不太舒服  | I don't feel well. |
| 他们自己去吧  我不去了  | They'll have to go without me. |
| 谢利  你没事吧  | Shelly, you okay? |
| 有事  | No. |
| 你想谈谈吗  | You want to talk about it? |
| 不想  | No. |
| 想一个人待会吗  | You want me to leave you alone? |
| 不想  | No. |
| 我本来以为和莉比是平辈相交  | I thought Libby and I were equals, |
| 谁知道她将我视为小孩子  | but she thinks of me as a child. |
| 很遗憾  宝贝  | I'm sorry, baby. |
| 现在这样叫我是雪上加霜  | Calling me that isn't helping right now. |
| 也是  对不起  | Right. Sorry. |
| 她的年纪几乎是你的两倍  | She is almost twice your age. |
| 有些人年纪比我大五倍  | There are people five times my age |
| 还是比我蠢啊  | that are stupider than me. |
| 这跟聪明没关系  | This is not about being smart. |
| -那还跟什么有关系  -这个嘛  | - What else is there? - ‭Well... |
| 人有其它方面的成熟  | there's other kinds of maturity. |
| 怎么了  | What's up? |
| 不关你的事  | None of your business. |
| 他为什么哭了  | Why is he crying? |
| 再说一遍  不关你的事  | Again, it's none of your business. |
| 请你离开  | Please go. |
| 好吧  塞莱斯特和我都很上道  | Fine. Celeste and I know when we aren't wanted. |
| 我们刚说到哪儿了  | Where were we? |
| 各种各样的成熟  | Different kinds of maturity. |
| 没错  | That's right. |
| 有情感上的成熟  身体上的成熟  | There's emotional maturity, physical maturity, |
| 很多都跟聪明与否无关  | all things that have nothing to do with being smart. |
| 你是在说我在情感上不成熟吗  | Are you suggesting I'm not emotionally mature? |
| 我只是暗示这一点  | I was hinting at it. |
| 不管怎样  我都不想再交朋友了  | Regardless, I'm not interested in making any more friends. |
| 我想那不是你真实的想法  | Oh, I don't think that's how you really feel. |
| 就是的  | It is. |
| 从今以后  我要过上隐士般的生活  | From now on, it's a hermit's life for me. |
| 我很肯定  你长大后  | I bet, when you grow up, you will be surrounded |
| 会交到很多聪明  优秀的朋友  | by lots of smart, wonderful friends. |
| 我觉得那是不可能的  | I can't see that happening. |
| 反正  | Well, |
