| 乔治  她就是跟你闹着玩  | George, she was just fooling with you. |
| 没  不是  她就是损  | No, no, she's mean. |
| 心都是黑的  | She got a black heart. |
| 她才不是  | She does not. |
| 你为什么总站在她那边  | Why do you always side with her? |
| 她是我妈啊  | Well, she is my mother. |
| 看吧  | And there it is. |
| 问题就在这  | There's the problem. |
| 你应该跟我同一阵线啊  | You should be siding with me. |
| -为了个牛胸肉吗  -不单是为了牛胸肉  | - Over brisket? - It's not just brisket. |
| 是她从认识我第一天起就这么对我  | It's the way she's been treating me since day one. |
| 就是把我当个废柴  安慰奖  | Like I'm some kind of loser, a booby prize. |
| -"安慰[胸部]奖"  -什么声音  | - "Booby prize." - What was that? |
| 小乔治  你少多管闲事  | Georgie, you mind your own business. |
| 我做什么了  | What did I do? |
| 怎么了  | What's going on? |
| 爸妈在吵架  | Mom and Dad are fighting. |
| 为了什么事  | What about? |
| 牛胸肉  | Brisket. |
| 如果他们离婚了   | If they get a divorce, who do you think |
| 你会选择跟谁过  | you'll pick to live with? |
| 当然是选妈啦  | Well, Mom, of course. |
| 我要选妈  你换选一个  | I want Mom. Pick again. |
| 我还以为爸爸也会来  | I thought Dad was coming. |
| 他不来  他有工作  | No, he had work to do. |
| 什么工作  不知道  教练的事情吧  | What kind of work? I don't know. Coaching stuff. |
| 他不能野餐完再去吗  | Can't he do it after the picnic? |
| -他没办法啊  米希  -为什么  | - No, Missy, he cannot. - Why not? |
| 别问了  | Enough. |
| 那为什么小乔治也没来  | How come Georgie's not going? |
| 他偷听我跟你爸爸说话被禁足了  | He's grounded for eavesdropping on me and your father. |
| 希望他学到教训了  | Well, I hope he learned his lesson. |
| 是为了食谱的事吗  | Is this about the recipe? |
| 我猜他是因为你总站在姥姥这边在生气  | I bet he's mad 'cause you always side with Meemaw. |
| 你怎么会知道这个  | And how would you know that? |
| 小乔治跟我说的  | Georgie told me. |
| 你跟爸爸要离婚了吗  | Are you and Dad getting a divorce? |
| 当然不会  | 'Course not. |
| 如果你们离婚  我想要跟着你过  | Well, if you do, I want to live with you. |
| 谢尔顿  我们不会离婚的  | Sheldon, no one's getting a divorce. |
| 不过谢谢你选我  | But thank you, honey. |
| 你知道这个问题  | You know this all goes away |
| 只要你给他食谱  就会烟消云散了吗  | if you just give him your recipe for the brisket. |
| 我知道啊  | I know. |
| 然后呢  | And? |
| 我猜这问题是哪都不会去了  | I guess it's not going away. |
| 我没有偷听  | And I wasn't eavesdropping. |
| 没事啦  | Don't worry about it. |
| 我只是不懂我为什么被禁足  | I just don't see why I got grounded. |
| 你有什么好抱怨的  | What are you complaining about? |
| 你本来也不想去教会野餐啊  | You didn't want to go to church picnic anyway. |
| 我就喜欢抱怨  我特能哔哔  | I like complaining. I'm good at it. |
| 我马上回来  | I'll be right back. |
| 你介意我喝一口你的啤酒吗  | Mind if I have a sip of your beer? |
| 你介意我把你脑袋塞进堆肥筒里吗  | You mind if I dip your head in the compost heap? |
| 你说介意不就好了吗  | You could have just said no. |
| 你在干嘛  | What are you doing? |
| 没干嘛  滚出去  | Nothing! Get out of here. |
| 你在找姥姥的牛胸肉食谱  | You're looking for her brisket recipe. |
| 这时候你就变天才啦  | All of a sudden you got smart? |
| 我说了让你出去  | I said get out of here. |
| 我发誓我不会泄密  | I won't tell, I swear. |
| 行吧  快来帮忙找  | All right, help me look. |
| 找到了吗  | Ooh. Found it? |
| 没有  这是她法式吐司的食谱  | No, this is her French toast. |
| 没让你找法式吐司  | You're not looking for French toast. |
| 这个姥姥也做得很好吃  | She does make it good, though. |
| 你知道她会在生奶油里加香草精吗  | Did you know she puts vanilla extract in her whipped cream? |
| 我不知道  | I did not. |
| 加1/4茶匙  | Quarter teaspoon. |
| -小乔治  -怎么了  | - Georgie? - Yeah? |
| 我们是来找牛胸肉食谱  | We're looking for brisket! |
| 暴脾气  | Cranky. |
| 我们回来啦  | We're home. |
| 别慌  | Be cool. |
| 我不慌啊  你才别慌呢  | I'm cool. You be cool. |
| 可真不慌啊  | Real cool. |
| 他以为我有写下来  | He thought I wrote it down. |
| 真是个傻子  | What a dope. |
| 苏打水  | Seltzer... |
| 生发水  生发水  | ...hair tonic. Hair tonic. |
| 需要帮忙哄孩子睡觉吗  | Need help putting the kids down? |
| 不用了  谢谢  我自己照顾了他们一天  | No, thank you, I've been taking care of them all day. |
| 我能自己收尾  | I think I can finish the job. |
| 干嘛啦  别这样  | Oh, come on, don't do that. |
| 别怎样  | Don't do what? |
| 没事  | Never mind. |
| 告诉你  谢尔顿跟米希  | Just so you know, Sheldon and Missy won |
| 赢了两人三脚赛跑  因为米希跟他说  | the three-legged race because she told him |
| 有蜜蜂在追他们  而你错过了这一幕  | a bee was chasing them, and you missed it. |
| 是我的错  我只是想远离你妈妈一会儿  | I'm sorry, I-I just needed a break from your mother. |
| 是啊  你也远离了你的家人  | Yeah, well, you took a break from your family. |
| 你们俩之间的不愉快是想闹多久  | How long is this feud between you two gonna go on? |
| 这得看她啊  | That's up to her. |
| 你们真是两头...  | You are both such... |
| 死固执的...  | stubborn... |
| 犟驴啊  | donkey butts! |
| 米希  | Missy! |

| 你怎么知道是不是我  | You don't know it's me. |
| 你想干嘛  | What do you want? |
| 别这样  | Don't be that way. |
| 我给你拿了瓶冰的  | I brought you a cold one. |
| 谢谢  | Thanks. |
| 还是不喜欢你  | I still don't like you. |
| 那这个能让你改变想法吗  | Would this change your feelings? |
| 就是这个吗  | Is that it? |
| 传说中的一个大秘宝  | The Holy Grail. |
| 是什么让你改变了心意  | What changed your mind? |
| 你今天不去野餐  | You not going to the picnic today, |
| 伤了玛丽与双胞胎的心  | that hurt Mary and the twins. |
| 我不想要内心有愧疚  | I cannot have that on my heart. |
| -是吗  -绝对  | - Is that so? - Absolutely. |
| 看着我的眼睛告诉我  | Look me in the eye and tell me |
| 这份是正确的食谱  | this is the actual recipe. |
| 乔治  在你手里的就是  | George, what you have in your hand |
| 正确的详细制作方式  | is the exact step-by-step instructions |
| 能让你做出我的招牌牛胸肉  | on how to make my brisket. |
| 在今晚之前我从没把这个食谱写下来过  | I have never written it down until tonight because... |
| 因为我怕会有人来偷  | I was afraid someone might steal it. |
| 但现在我把它托付给你  | But I'm entrusting this to you, |
| 希望有一天  时机成熟时  | and I hope that someday, when the time is right, |
| 你会传给你其中一个孩子  | you will see fit to share it with one of your children. |
| 康妮  我不知道该说什么好  | Connie, I don't know what to say. |
| 别叫我康妮  | Don't call me Connie. |
| 叫我妈妈  | Call me Mom. |
| 谢谢  妈妈  | Thanks, Mom. |
| 不客气  儿子  | You're welcome, son. |
| 真是个傻子  | What a dope. |
| 第二天早上  我爸为了做出完美的牛胸肉  | The next morning, my dad embarked on a doomed quest |
| 踏上了注定失败的征途  | to make the perfect brisket. |
| 能帮你什么吗  | Can I help you? |
| 还真需要你帮忙  | Matter of fact, you can. |
| 我需要5公斤特优级安格斯牛胸肉  | I need 12 pounds of prime Angus with a medium deckle, |
| 最好是春天宰的  不能晚于六月中旬  | ideally slaughtered in the spring, no later than mid-June. |
| 至于腌肉的香料  | For the spice rub, |
| 姥姥让他开车去新奥尔良  | Meemaw had him drive to New Orleans |
| 到知名咖啡馆买研磨咖啡粉  | to buy ground coffee from Cafe Du Monde, |
| 以及到一名叫拉沃夫人的女巫那里  | and seven ounces of something called "holy ghost root" |
| 买28克的"圣灵根"  | from a voodoo woman named Madam Laveau. |
| 请问你能磨我的"根"吗  | Could you grind my root for me? |
| 我要涂在牛胸上  | I-I'm-a... I'm-a rub it on brisket. |
| 回家后  他给牛胸抹上香料的手法  | Then back home, he applied the spice rub |
| 充满情欲又温柔  | with such erotic tenderness, |
| 我妈都有点妒忌了呢  | it made my mother a little jealous. |
| 最终  开始烹饪了  | Finally, the cooking began. |
| 弄了整整14小时  | 14 hours of cooking. |
| 期间不断刷油  | And basting. |
| 喷油  | And spritzing. |
| 和照料火候  | And tending to the fire. |
| 终于到了让胸肉阴凉的步骤  | Until it was finally time to let the meat rest. |
| 休息[阴凉]吧  小亲亲  | Rest, my darling. |
| 好好休息  | Rest. |
| 知名咖啡店的咖啡真好喝呀  | Mmm. This Cafe Du Monde coffee is very good. |
| 里面加了菊苣  | They make it with chicory. |
| 这对做牛胸肉有什么好处  | And what does it do to the brisket? |
| 我不知道  | Oh, I have no idea. |
| 那你为什么让乔治大老远跑去新奥尔良  | Then why did you send George all the way to New Orleans? |
| 咱家附近买不到这种咖啡啊  | Well, they don't sell this around here. |
| 来了  | Here we go. |
| 耗时15年零14小时  | 15 years and 14 hours later. |
| 全德州最好吃的牛胸肉  | Best brisket in Texas. |
| 康妮  你这个邪恶的贱人  | Connie, you evil bitch! |
| 比普通咖啡丝滑很多呢  | It's smoother than regular coffee. |
| 那才不是真的秘方  | That wasn't the recipe. |
| 你看着我的眼睛说谎了  | You looked me in the eye, and you lied to me. |
| 妈妈  | Oh, Mom. |
| 你偷摸闯进我家  想偷食谱  | You broke into my home and tried to steal it. |
| 乔治  | Oh, George. |
| 你告诉她我们进去过吗  | You told her we went over there? |
| 小乔治  | Oh, George Jr. |
| 我什么都没招  不是我  | I didn't say nothing. I was cool. |
| 真喜欢这台好戏  | I am loving this. |
| 我家不再欢迎这个女人来  | I don't want this woman in my house anymore. |
| -她可是我妈  -她就是恶魔  | - She is my mother. - She is the devil. |
| 要是孩子们想见她呢  | And what if the kids want to see her? |
| 好吧  | Fine. |
| 在我不在家时才能来  | Schedule it for when I'm not here. |
| 或者等我死了再来  | Or when I'm dead. |
| 还有  不许你喝我的咖啡了  | And quit drinking my coffee. |
| 把你的火车关掉  我们得谈谈  | Turn off your train, we've got to talk. |
| 谈什么  | About what? |
| 妈妈为爸爸和姥姥的事很难过  | Mom is so upset about Dad and Meemaw, |
| 她可能会想离婚  | she might want a divorce. |
| 没人要离婚  | No one's getting divorced. |
| 你怎么知道  | How do you know? |
| "真棒"  这下我得把那个扔了  | Great, now I have to throw that out. |
| 当女婿的自古以来都瞧不起丈母娘  | Mother-in-laws are always held in low regard by the father. |
| 但这很少会导致家庭破裂  | It rarely leads to a breakup of the family. |
| 他说得对  | He's right. |
| 弗雷德和威尔玛的婚姻依然幸福美满  | Fred and Wilma are still happily married. |
| 我想如果你能  | I think if we can figure out |
| 想个办法  让爸爸得到姥姥的牛胸肉食谱  | a way for Dad to get Meemaw's brisket recipe, |
| 所有矛盾就会消失  | this all goes away. |
| 我想不出我们能有什么办法  | I don't see how we can accomplish that. |
| 放下  | Put that down. |
| 那可不是玩具  | That's not a toy. |
| 当然是啦  | Sure it is. |
| 呜呜  | Choo choo. |
| 呜呜  | Choo choo... |
| 呜呜  | Choo choo. |
| 张嘴嘴  小饼饼  | Open wide, Moonpie. |
| 呜呜小火车来啦  | Here comes the choo choo train. |
| 呜呜  | Choo choo. |
| 很好吃对吧  | Mmm. Isn't that good? |
| 这是姥姥远近驰名的牛胸肉  | That's Meemaw's famous brisket. |
| 你想知道食谱吗  | Would you like the secret recipe? |
| 你保证不告诉别人  | You promise not to tell anybody? |
| 你当然不会告诉别人啦  | Of course you're not gonna tell anybody. |
| 我先加入一茶匙孜然  | I start with a tablespoon of cumin, |
| 然后加入一杯红糖  之后...  | and then a cup of brown sugar, and... |
| 我知道姥姥的食谱  | I know the recipe. |
| 什么  | What? |
| 她告诉我的  | She told it to me. |
| 什么时候  | When? |
| 1982年2月14日  | February 14, 1982. |
| 当时我23个月大  那天是情人节  | I was 23 months old, it was Valentine's Day, |
| 爸爸和妈妈出去餐厅吃饭了  | and Mom and Dad went out for dinner. |
| 当时你也在场  你不记得吗  | You were there. Don't you remember? |
| 一片空白  | I got nothing. |
| 那么小的时候的事你真的还记得吗  | You can really remember when you were that little? |
| 嗯  你也在场  | Uh-huh. You were there, too. |
| 你还在学习自己上厕所  | You were still struggling with potty training. |
| 你记错了吧  | I don't think so. |
| 没有  姥姥以前都叫你尿裤子先生  | Oh, yes. Meemaw used to call you Mr. Soggy Pants. |
| 不可能  | Nuh-uh. |
| 尿裤子先生  | Mr. Soggy Pants. |
| 闭嘴  这不好笑  | Quit it. This is serious. |
| 谢尔顿  你必须把食谱告诉爸爸  | Sheldon, you've got to tell Dad that recipe. |
| 但姥姥说这是秘密  | But Meemaw told me it was a secret. |
| 你如果不说  等爸妈离婚了  就是你的错  | If you don't, and Mom and Dad get a divorce, it's your fault. |
| 好吧  | All right. |
| 我说  | Fine. |
| 干得漂亮  尿裤子先生  | Good job, Soggy Pants. |
| 爸爸  你能来客厅吗  | Dad, could you please come into the living room? |
| 干什么  | What for? |
| 我的大脑做了超厉害的事  | My brain did something impressive |
| 我想和你分享  | and I'd like to share it with you. |
| 你怎么会在这儿  | What are you doing here? |
| 跟你一样  | Same as you. |
| 我想看他的大脑做了什么  | I want to see what his brain did. |
| 请坐  | Please have a seat. |
| 好吧  | All right. |
| 怎么样  | Well? |
| 我知道姥姥的牛胸肉烹饪食谱  | I know Meemaw's brisket recipe. |
| 什么  | What? |
| 你才不知道呢  | No, you don't. |
| 我真的知道  | Yes, I do. |
| 为了给这个家带来安宁  | And in order to bring peace to this family, |
| 我决定公之于众  | I'm prepared to make it public. |
| 你想诈我  | You're bluffing. |
| 一茶匙孜然  | One tablespoon of cumin, |
| 一杯红糖  | one cup of brown sugar, |
| 两茶匙烟熏红椒  | two tablespoons of smoked paprika... |
| 好了  好了  停  | Okay, okay, stop. |
| 不不  继续说  | No, no, no. Keep going. |
| 你怎么会知道食谱  谢利  | How do you know the recipe, Shelly? |
| 姥姥在1982年的情人节告诉我的  | Meemaw told it to me on Valentine's Day, 1982. |
| 你和爸爸去廉价影院  | You were out with Dad seeing Cannonball Run |
| 看《炮弹飞车》了  | at the dollar theater. |
| 不可能  你当时还不到两岁  | That's impossible, you weren't even two years old. |
| 三茶匙干芥末  | Three tablespoons of dried mustard, |
| 一杯孤星啤酒  | one cup of Lone Star beer... |
| 好了  | Okay. |
| 好了  | Okay. |
| 说吧  | Go ahead. |
| 告诉你爸爸吧  | Give it to your father. |
| 我可以帮你写下来  | I can write it down for you. |
| 不用了  我不想要  | That's okay, I don't want it. |
| 你逗我呢吧  | You have got to be kidding me. |
| 康妮  你有无数的机会  | Connie, you've had every opportunity |
| 把食谱给我  但你从来没给  | to give me that recipe and you never did, |
| 因为你一直把我当做外人  | because you've always treated me like an outsider. |
| 她才没有  | No, she has not. |
| 我当然有  | Oh, of course I have. |
| 看到没  她承认了  | See? She admits it. |
| 我当然承认了  | Damn right, I do. |
| 我一直觉得你配不上我女儿  | Never thought you were good enough for my daughter. |
| 你就这么出现  骑着那辆破摩托车  | There you were, riding around on that dumb motorcycle, |
| 把她肚子搞大  | knocking her up. |
| 孩子们  你们都到厨房  | Why don't you kids go in the kitchen |
| 自己拿点冰淇淋吃吧  | and fix yourselves some ice cream? |
| 我怎么能错过这好戏  | I'm not going anywhere. |
| 我能理解  | Hey. I get it. |
| 我也有个女儿  | I have a daughter. |
| 我也不想她带一个那样的男人回家  | I wouldn't want her bringing home someone like that. |
| 但我也比那时候成长了许多  | But I've come a hell of a long way since then. |
| 好啦  你说得对  | Okay, you're right. |
| 乔治  | George. |
| 对不起  | I'm sorry. |
| 这对我来说  比任何食谱都更有意义  | That means more to me than any recipe. |
| 过来  | Come here. |
| 别让这个拥抱骗了你  | Don't let the hug fool you. |
| 她一走  他就逼我把食谱告诉他  | The minute she went home, he made me give him the recipe. |
| 来啦  处女航  | Here we go, maiden voyage. |
| 哎妈呀  | Hot damn. |
