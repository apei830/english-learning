| 随便哪天  | On any given day, |
| 我们学校的体育馆都会发生各式各样的恐怖事  | our school gymnasium presented a cocktail of horrors. |
| 从日常丢脸  | From daily humiliation... |
| 到学校认可的暴力  | ...to school-sanctioned violence... |
| 但每年有那么一天  体育馆会摇身一变  | But one day a year, the gymnasium was transformed |
| 成为学习的殿堂  | into a haven of learning |
| 这都要感谢一个了不起的惯例  | thanks to a remarkable institution |
| 科学展  | known as the science fair. |
| 全体学生都有机会  | A chance for the student body to come together |
| 以研究和进步之名齐聚一堂  | in the name of research and progress. |
| 有些人毫不努力  | Uh, while some did the bare minimum... |
| 其他人则喜欢作秀多过原始数据  | ...and others preferred razzamatazz over raw data, |
| 范德格拉夫起电机  | 产生静电高压的装置 |
| 我致力于拯救人类不被致命小行星灭绝  | I set out to save humanity from deadly asteroids. |
| 小行星的追踪和偏移  | 由谢尔顿·李·库珀呈现 |
| 我把内容都整齐排在三块硬纸板上  | And made it all neatly fit on three poster boards. |
| 科学展也许是场比赛  | The science fair may be a competition, |
| 但当目的是分享知识时  我们都是赢家  | but when the goal is promoting knowledge, we're all winners. |
| 赢得  | And the winner |
| 梅德福高中科学展的就是...  | of the Medford High School Science Fair is... |
| 苏安·拉德洛  | SueAnn Ludlow! |
| 你逗我呢吧  | You've got to be kidding me! |
| 谢利  | Shelly. |
| 你们这些人都疯了  | You people are crazy! |
| 好了  | Hey. ‭All right. |
| 你们在赞美平庸  | You're celebrating mediocrity! |
| 平庸  | Mediocrity! |
| 平庸啊  | Mediocrity! |
| ♪ 世上没人比我强壮 ♪  | ♪ Nobody else is stronger than I am ♪ |
| ♪ 昨天我移了一座山 ♪  | ♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪ |
| ♪ 我相信我能当你的英雄 ♪  | ♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪ |
| ♪ 我是个了不起的小家伙 ♪  | ♪ I am a mighty little man ♪ |
| ♪ 我是个了不起的小家伙 ♪  | ♪ I am a mighty little man ♪ |
| 少  | 年 |
| 我回房间去了  | I'll be in my room. |
| 别这样  谢利  | Oh, come on, Shelly. |
| 你还是得到优等奖了呀  | You still got an honorable mention. |
| 别提起我的伤心事了  | Stop reminding me. |
| 我讨厌看到他如此不开心  | I hate to see him so upset. |
| 给他点时间嘛  他会冷静下来的  | Well, give him a little time, he'll calm down. |
| 狗屁不通  | Fiddle-faddle! |
| 都骂脏字了  | The F word. |
| 他真的很生气  | He's real mad. |
| 生活中并非次次能赢  他需要学会这点  | You don't always win in life, he needs to learn that. |
| 我知道  但这对小男孩来说是很激烈的情绪  | I know, but these are big feelings for a little boy. |
| 每个人都有这种情绪  | They're feelings everybody has. |
| 这是成长必经阶段  | It's part of growing up. |
| 说得也是  | I guess. |
| 狗狗屎  | Poodle poop! |
| 好了  | Okay. |
| 得有人去教这孩子如何骂脏话了  | Somebody's got to teach this kid to swear, |
| 这样很丢人  | it's embarrassing. |
| 谢尔顿  听着  | Sheldon, listen, |
| 我知道输很难接受  | I know losing ain't easy. |
| 我在橄榄球场上经常要面对这个  | I deal with it on the football field all the time. |
| 就像我们去年对纳卡多奇斯队那场重要的比赛  | It's like that big game we had last year against Nacogdoches. |
| 中场休息时我们落后28分  | We were down 28 points at the half. |
| 当时在下雨  一片泥泞  | It was raining, it was muddy. |
| 看台上的人全都回家了  | Everybody in the stands had gone home. |
| 但不知怎的  我们成功在终场前一分钟  | But somehow, we managed to claw our way back |
| 追成平手  | to a tie with a minute left. |
| 然后他们传了一个孤注一掷的长传  | And then, they threw a Hail Mary, |
| 接球员走出界外  | and the receiver stepped out of bounds, |
| 但裁判没看到  | but the ref didn't see it. |
| 经历了这么多后  我们输在了错判上  | After all that, we lose on a bad call. |
| 相信我  我当时气炸了  | Believe me, I was furious. |
| 但我忍住了  | But I sucked it up, |
| 我走到球场另一边  跟他们握手  | and I walked across that field and I shook their hands. |
| 你刚说的我一个字都没听进去  | I didn't hear a word you said. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 动物细胞有细胞膜  | So while an animal cell has a membrane, |
| 植物细胞则有细胞膜和细胞壁  | a plant cell has a membrane and a cell wall. |
| 谁在乎啊  | Who cares? |
| 谢尔顿  你在干什么  | Sheldon, what are you doing? |
| 目无尊长  老师  | Being disrespectful, sir. |
| 为什么  | Ah. How come? |
| 因为我对学校制度幻灭了  | Because I'm disillusioned with the school system. |
| 小乔治  你知道他怎么回事吗  | Georgie, do you know what's going on with him? |
| 事实上  我在努力无视他  | Actually, I'm trying to ignore it. |
| 你把脚放下来  | Well, get your feet off the desk. |
| 如果我不放呢  | What if I don't? |
| 老师叫我来见彼得森校长  | I was sent to see Principal Petersen. |
| 这次你又做了什么  | What is it this time? |
| 青春期叛逆  | Youthful rebellion. |
| 我还没变声  但我的态度变了  | My voice hasn't changed yet, but my attitude has. |
| 我通知他你来了  | I'll let him know you're here. |
| 麻利点儿  | You do that. |
| 女士  | Ma'am. |
| 谢尔顿·库珀在外面  | Sheldon Cooper's outside. |
| 这次是谁叫他来的  | Who sent him now? |
| -吉文斯  -你知道吗  | - Givens. ‭- Well, you know what? |
| 吉文斯应该爷们一点  | Givens needs to man up. |
| 库珀只是个小男孩  | Cooper's a little boy. |
| 对付他一点都不难啊  | It's not hard to handle him. |
| 我叫他进来  | I'll send him in. |
| 先等一下  | H-Hold on a minute, just... |
| 他知道我在办公室吗  | Does he know I'm in here? |
| 全体学生和教员请注意  | Attention, students and faculty. |
| 糟了  | Oh, no. |
| 我是谢尔顿·李·库珀  | This is Sheldon Lee Cooper. |
| 搞什么  | What the hell? |
| 我们被教导努力会有回报  但那不是真的  | We're taught that hard work pays off, but that's not true. |
| 我想出了从致命小行星手中  | I came up with a solution to save Earth |
| 拯救地球的方法  | from killer asteroids, |
| 却在科学展中  | and lost the science fair |
| 输给了苏安·拉德洛  及她的炸头毛机器  | to SueAnn Ludlow, and her frizzy hair machine. |
| 但输的不只是我  我们都输了  | But it wasn't just me who lost, we all lost. |
| 你们清醒一点  | Wake up, people. |
| 这个体制已经崩坏了  | The system's broken. |
| 真正的创新不被重视  | Real innovation isn't valued. |
| 这年头  浮夸和有型才是王道  | Nowadays, it's all about flash and style. |
| 都怪MTV台  | I blame MTV. |
| 音乐电视网频道  节目主要面向青少年  | 有时被人诟病推广脑残内容 |
| 幸好我的父母订不起有线电视台  | Luckily, my parents can't afford cable. |
| 我们订得起啦  | We can afford it. |
| 我敦促你们都起来反抗  | I urge you all to rise up. |
| 法不责众  不可能全都去见校长  | They can't send everyone to the principal's office. |
| 在课上嚼口香糖  改用一号铅笔  | Chew gum in class, use a number one pencil, |
| 疯起来吧  | go nuts. |
| 谢尔顿·李·库珀发言完毕  | This is Sheldon Lee Cooper signing off. |
| 生生不息  繁荣昌盛  | Live long and prosper. |
| 有种你别跑  小兔崽子  | You better run, you little punk! |
| 真不敢相信你让他饿着肚子就上床睡觉  | I can't believe you sent him to bed without his dinner. |
| 没错  | That's right. |
| 而且今晚还是吃热狗意粉  | On spaghetti and hot dog night. |
| -够残忍  -他必须学会教训  | - That's rough. ‭- He's got to learn. |
| 我们聊点别的吧  | Let's talk about something else. |
| 小乔治  你今天过得怎么样  | Georgie, how was your day? |
| 我弟弟告诉全校的人我们家订不起有线电视  | My brother told the entire school we can't afford cable. |
| 对哦  | Oh, right. |
| 米希  | Missy? |
| 本来挺好  直到听说我们订不起有线电视  | Good, until I learned we can't afford cable. |
| 我一直在思考  我有话想说  | I've been thinking, and there's something I'd like to say. |
| 除非是道歉  否则就不用说了  | Unless it's an apology, I don't want to hear it. |
| 我要放弃科学  | I'm quitting science. |
| 并不是道歉  | Not an apology. |
| 打他屁股  爸爸  | Spank him, Dad. |
| 我真的开始担心谢利了  | I'm really getting worried about Shelly. |
| 之前是发脾气  现在还要放弃科学  | Acting out, and now quitting science? |
| 他一定马上就重新沉迷科学的  | Oh, I'm sure he'll get right back to it. |
| 我也戒过烟和赌博很多次了  | I've quit smoking and gambling plenty of times. |
| 打开我包包看看  | Hmm. Look in my purse. |
| 里面只有烟和刮刮乐彩票  | Nothing but cigarettes and scratchers. |
| 也许他该找人谈谈  | Maybe he should talk to somebody. |
| 做梦  | Not it. |
| 我是指跟专业人士谈  乔治  | I meant a professional, George. |
| 不过你可真是"好"爸爸啊  | But way to be a dad. |
| 欢迎回来  | Welcome back. |
| 谢谢你这么快就腾出时间见我们  医生  | Thank you for seeing us on such short notice, Doctor. |
| 不客气  | Oh, not a problem. |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon, |
| 我记得你  | I remember you. |
| 你记得我吗  | Do you remember me? |
| 我什么都记得  | I remember everything. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 二位女士请随意  | Uh, you two, make yourselves comfortable. |
| 我跟我兄弟谢尔顿  | Me and my main man Sheldon are gonna go |
| 要到我办公室里好好聊聊  | have a little chitchat in my office. |
| 我不喜欢聊天  我也不是你兄弟  | I don't like chitchat, and I'm not your main man. |
| 好极了  | Right on. |
| 玩得开心  | Have fun. |
| 谢尔顿  我知道你改变主意  | Now, Sheldon, I understand you've changed your mind |
| 不想当科学家了  | about being a scientist. |
| 你打算说我不能这么做吗  | And you're gonna say I can't? |
| 不  我觉得那样很棒  | No. I think that's great. |
| -真的吗  -嗯  | - You do? - ‭Yeah. |
| 我认为对人生选择保持开放态度是好事  | I think it's important to keep your options open. |
| 让我告诉你一个小故事  | Let me tell you a little story |
| 主角是一个非常聪明的小男孩  | about an extremely smart young boy. |
| 我吗  | Me? |
| 是我  | Me. |
| 有很长一段时间  | For the longest time, |
| 我都以为自己会成为  | I thought I was gonna be |
| 一名专业花样滑冰运动员  | a professional figure skater. |
| 然后你跟我一样对那个领域幻想破灭了吗  | And then you became disenchanted with the field like I did? |
| 正是  | Exactly. |
| 有人穿着冰鞋在我脚上滑过  | Someone skated right over my foot. |
| 从此没戏了  | And that was that. |
| 我不确定这是一回事  | I'm not sure that's the same thing. |
| 你失去激情与我失去脚趾的方式如出一辙  | I'd say you lost your passion the way I lost my big toe. |
| 别在上面乱画  | Don't draw in that. |
| 我们结束了  | Hey. We're all done. |
| -怎么样  -很好  | - How'd it go? ‭- Great. |
| 我感觉好多了  | I feel a lot better. |
| 实在太棒了  | Well, that's just wonderful. |
| 那你要继续研究科学吗  | So, you're going back to science? |
| 不  事实上我要离科学越远越好  | No. In fact, I'm going as far away from science as possible. |
| 我打算投身艺术行业  | I plan to pursue the arts. |
| 哪种艺术  | What kind of arts? |
| 我决定以后要当演员  | I've decided to become an actor. |
| 不出所料  | Of course you have. |
| 他为什么想学演戏  | Why's he want to study acting? |
| 医生鼓励他尝试不一样的东西  | The doctor encouraged him to try something different. |
| 也许他能学会表现得像正常人  | Maybe he'll learn to act normal. |
| 不如你学学如何友善待人吧  | How about you learn to act nice? |
| 你们都不懂欣赏我的幽默感  | You people don't appreciate my sense of humor. |
| 只要他开始在学校乖乖的  | As long as he starts behaving himself in school, |
| 我不在乎他做什么  | I don't care what he does. |
| 其实我20几岁时  曾在一个社区小剧团  | You know, I actually did a little community theater |
| 演过戏  | back in my 20s. |
| 是吗  | Is that so? |
| 我在《俄克拉荷马》演了个很棒的角色  | I had a good part in Oklahoma. |
| ♪ 我就是一个无法拒绝的女孩 ♪  | ♪ I'm just a girl who can't say no. ♪ |
| 拒绝什么  | Say no to what? |
| 这个嘛  | Well... |
| 无法拒绝吃蔬菜  | To, uh, eating her vegetables. |
| 特别好玩  | It was fun. |
| 不过我很肯定排戏  | But I'm pretty sure doing plays |
| 只是为了能在后台一起换衣服  | is just an excuse to change in front of each other backstage. |
| -真的吗  -是啊  | - Really? ‭- Yeah. |
| 戏剧圈的人可爱脱衣服了  | Theater folk just love to take their clothes off. |
| 有多少人看过你的裸体  | How many people saw you naked? |
| 很多  | A lot. |
| -妈妈  -够了  | - Mom. - ‭Enough. |
| 你们也不懂我的幽默  | Y'all don't understand my sense of humor, either. |
| 你好  请问你是伦迪老师[先生]吗  | Hello. Are you Mr. Lundy? |
| 我父亲才是伦迪先生  | My father is Mr. Lundy. |
| 那我应该怎么称呼你  | Well, then what should I call you? |
| 伦迪先生吧  | I guess Mr. Lundy. |
| 毕竟我爸不在了  | My father's dead. |
| 他们告诉我你是戏剧部的负责人  | I was told you're the head of the drama department. |
| 没错  也是女子排球队的教练  | Mm-hmm, and the girls' volleyball coach, |
| 偷偷告诉你  那边的人戏才多  | which, between us, is the real drama department. |
| 这是个笑话吗  | Was that a joke? |
| 我觉得是  | I thought so. |
| 你有什么事  | Can I help you? |
| 我想当演员  | I'm interested in becoming an actor. |
| 那敢情好  | Well, good for you. |
| 你来这里就对了  | You've come to the right place. |
| 我也是个职业演员呢  | You know, I-I've been a professional actor |
| 当了好多好多年了  | for years and years. |
| 真的吗  你演过什么  | Really? What have you been in? |
| 你看过一个床垫的广告吗  | Well, have you seen the mattress madness commercials |
| 在68频道播出的  | on channel 68? |
| 我又柔软又结实  | I'm soft and firm |
| 该软则软  该结实则结实  | in all the right places. |
| 你是名人啊  | Wow. You're famous. |
| 这个嘛...  | Well, I... |
| 我也曾经出演过  | And I was Carbucketty |
| 达拉斯沃斯堡市制作的音乐剧《猫》  | in the Dallas-Fort Worth Players production of Cats. |
| 看到没  | Did you see that? |
| 不要  我怕猫  | No, I'm afraid of cats. |
| 你知道那些猫都是演员演的吧  | Well, you realize the cats are just the actors. |
| 我还是不想冒这个险  | I still wouldn't risk it. |
| 你真是个奇特的孩子  但你应该能行  | You're an odd boy, but you make it work. |
| 好了  试镜是在下周  | Anyway, uh, auditions are next week. |
| -到时候欢迎你来  -太好了  | - You're welcome to come on by. - Excellent. |
| 我借了一本讲演戏的书  | I checked out a book on acting |
| 到时候我应该已经掌握得差不多了  | so I should have the hang of it by then. |
| 我喜欢你这自信  | Well, I like that confidence. |
| 谢谢  大多数人都觉得反感  | Thank you. Most people find it off-putting. |
| 我也能理解  | I can see that. |
| 要想掌握演戏  我先让自己  | To master acting, I immersed myself |
| 沉浸在各种不同类型的作品里  从默片  | in all forms of the genre, from silent films |
| 到现代经典  | to modern classics... |
| 1952年的不朽音乐歌舞片杰作《雨中曲》  | 歌曲名《Good morning》 |
| 到反逻辑的实验性作品  | ...to logic-defying experimental work. |
| ♪ 睡懒觉最棒了 ♪   | ♪ It's great to stay up late... ♪ |
| 他们为什么都在唱歌  | Why are they all singing? |
| 因为这是歌舞片啊  | Because it's a musical. |
| 他们为什么不能用说的呢  | But why can't they just say it? |
| 那就不够"歌舞"了  不是吗  | Well, that wouldn't be very musical, would it? |
| ♪ 繁星在闪耀 ♪  | ♪ The stars were shining bright... ♪ |

| 你在找什么  | What are you looking for? |
| 胸针  | A brooch. |
| 什么是胸针  | What's a brooch? |
| 是一种首饰  | It's a piece of jewelry. |
| 在演戏的书里有个小练习  | In my acting book, there's an exercise |
| 就是你得用令人信服的方式寻找一个胸针  | where you look for a missing brooch in a convincing way. |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 根据书中的背景故事  这个是我朋友送的  | According to the story, it was given to me by a friend |
| 让我变卖好继续读戏剧学校  被我弄丢了    | so I could afford to stay in drama school, but now it's gone. |
| 祝你早日找到啦  | Well, good luck finding it. |
| 谢谢  | Thanks. |
| 等等  | Wait. |
| 你真的相信了我是在找东西  | You really believed I was looking for something. |

| 我们回来了  | We're back. |
| 试镜如何啦  | Hey. How'd the audition go? |
| 很好啊  我演主角  | Great. I got the lead. |
| 不是吧  | You're kidding. |
| 什么剧目啊  | What's the play? |
| 1982年一部讲述红发女孩孤儿安妮的  | 欢乐冒险的音乐剧 |
| 《安妮》  | Annie. |
| 我要去学习我的台词了  | I need to go learn my lines. |
| 我刚听到时心里也有疑虑  | Now, I was a little unsure at first, |
| 但女演员桑迪·邓肯也曾反串演过《小飞侠》  | but Sandy Duncan does play Peter Pan, |
| 所以如果你自己想想  | so when you think about it... |
| 康妮  你说这话纯帮倒忙  | Connie, you're not helping. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 我想跟你聊聊这舞台剧的事  | I want to talk to you about this play. |
| 我也很兴奋  | I'm excited about it, too. |
| 你知道你要是扮演女孩角色  | You know, if you play the part of a girl, |
| 别人很有可能会取笑你吧  | people might make fun of you. |
| 伦迪先生想要冲击德州东部  | Mr. Lundy's trying to push the boundaries |
| 大家对戏剧的界限  | of drama in East Texas. |
| 其中一个方式就是女角男演  | One way to do that is cross-gender casting. |
| 让我修正一下我的措辞  | Let me rephrase that: |
| 如果你去扮女生  别人一定会取笑你  | if you play the part of a girl, people will make fun of you. |
| 在莎士比亚的年代  所有的女角都是男人演的  | In Shakespeare's time, the men played all the female parts. |
| 也没人取笑他们啊  | No one made fun of it. |
| 如果莎士比亚去上了公立学校  | If Shakespeare went to public high school, |
| 那情况就不会是这样了  | it'd be a different story. |
| 你知道桑迪·邓肯也演过男角色彼得潘吧  | You know, Sandy Duncan plays the part of Peter Pan... |
| 是啦  我听说了  | Yeah, yeah, I heard. |
| 儿子  爸爸也是想保护你  | I'm trying to protect you, son. |
| 我谢谢你的好意  | I appreciate that. |
| 很好  | Good. |
| 你是个橄榄球教练  | You're a football coach. |
| 你的责任不就是  | Isn't it your responsibility |
| 把球员安排在最适合的位子上吗  | to put in the best player for the job? |
| 大概吧  | I guess. |
| 我想演戏  | Well, I want to do this, |
| 而伦迪先生说我是最棒的  | and Mr. Lundy said I was the best. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 那你能起码穿裤子而不穿裙子吗  | Can you at least wear pants instead of a dress? |
| 我给你个十分肯定的可能吧  | I'll give you a definite maybe. |
| 好了  谁很期待啊  | Okay, who's excited? |
| 我不想看谢尔顿的白痴舞台剧  太丢人了  | I don't want to see Sheldon's stupid play, it's humiliating. |
| 这正是我想看的原因  | That's why I want to see it. |
| 我们要去支持你弟弟  | We're going to support your brother. |
| 我不想再听你们说任何一个字  | Not another word about it. |
| 我们能好歹坐到后排去吗  | Can we at least sit in the back? |
| 不许再说  | Not a word. |
| 我很期待啊  | Well, I'm excited. |
| 好了  大家  还有10分钟就开演了  | Okay, everybody, ten minutes to curtain. |
| 姑娘们  不许笑  生活很艰难  | No smiling, girls, it's a hard knock life. |
| 你怎么样啦  库珀先生  | How you doing, Mr. Cooper? |
| 跟内心的安妮起共鸣了吗  | You in touch with your inner Annie? |
| 有的吧  | I believe so. |
| 太好了  今天满座呢  | Good. It's a packed house. |
| 哇  什么鬼  | Wha-- oh, what the heck? |
| 凯蒂  凯蒂  你是孤儿  | Katie? Katie. You're an orphan, |
| 亲爱的  不是矿工  | sweetheart, not a coal miner. |
| 稍微收敛一点好吗  | Let's tone that down, hmm? |
