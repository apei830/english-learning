| 《少年谢尔顿》前情提要  | Previously on Young Sheldon... |
| 你们认识洛圣朋先生吗  | You know that Mr. Rosenbloom |
| 在牛排馆附近开家具店的那个  | with the furniture store over by the steak house? |
| 他约我去共进晚餐  | He's asked me to dinner. |
| 他是你男朋友吗  | Is he your boyfriend? |
| 是我其中一个  所以别提这方面的事  | Well, he's one of them, so let's not bring that up. |
| 好啦  我有何能为你效劳  | All right, so what can I do for you? |
| 当犹太人是什么感觉  | What's it like to be Jewish? |
| 烂透了  我不建议  | Oh, it's terrible. I don't recommend it. |
| 怎么了  | Yeah? |
| 康妮  我是想邀请你今晚一起吃饭  | Connie, I would like to have dinner with you tonight. |
| 看起来情势一片大好  | This is very promising. |
| 斯特吉斯博士和姥姥  | Dr. Sturgis and Meemaw |
| 第一次一起过夜了  | had their first sleepover. |
| 这是他们恋爱关系的重大进展  | It's a big step in their relationship. |
| 我要去恭喜他们  | I'm going to go congratulate them. |
| 先穿上外套  外面很冷  | Hey, put on a jacket, it's chilly out. |
| 你好像甜点永远都只吃香草冰激凌  | I have only seen you eat vanilla ice cream for dessert. |
| -这是为什么  -我是跟一个  | - Why is that? - Well, I've taken a page |
| 伟大的物理学家理查德·费曼学的  | from the great physicist Richard Feynman. |
| 为了减少生命中总要下的其中一个决定  | In order to have one less decision in his life |
| 他决定甜点永远只吃巧克力冰激凌  | he decided that dessert would always be chocolate ice cream. |
| 听起来这觉得有点无聊  | Sounds like it could get kind of boring. |
| 的确是  | Oh, it does. |
| 但在过去35年间  | But over the last 35 years |
| 我相信我因此起码省下了一天半的生命  | I believe I've saved at least a day and a half. |
| 有机会你一定得让我也为你做饭  | Well, you have to let me cook for you sometime. |
| 但我很喜欢为你做饭啊  | But I enjoy cooking for you. |
| 是我向你表达爱意的一种方式  | It's a means of expressing my affection. |
| 而且这样我才能控制菜里放多少大蒜  | It also allows me to control the amount of garlic |
| 因为那会让我打嗝  | which gives me the burps. |
| 我做的烤肉超级好吃  | Well, I do make a mean barbecue |
| 我可以保证不放任何大蒜  | and I promise I can make it garlic-free. |
| 太棒了  | Excellent! |
| 下一次就让你向我表达爱意吧  | Next time, you can express your affection for me. |
| 失陪一下  | Excuse me. |
| 估计是谢尔顿打来查岗  | I bet it's Sheldon checking on us. |
| 干嘛  | What? |
| 康妮  我是艾拉  | Connie? It's Ira. |
| 我...  | I'm, uh... |
| 是谢尔顿  | I-It's Sheldon. |
| 他听起来好像有点焦躁  | He... sounds a little agitated. |
| 我到旁边去接一下电话  | I'm gonna take it in the other room. |
| 稍等...  | Just... |
| 你继续说吧  | Hello again. |
| 是这样的  我想问一下你周末有没有安排  | Listen, I'm wondering what you're doing this weekend. |
| 我想你了  | I miss you. |
| 很好  很好  | Cool, cool. |
| 想一起去看个电影吗  | You want to go to a movie |
| 或者是打几局保龄球  | or bowl a few frames? |
| 是这样的  我现在不太方便讲电话  | Uh, you know, listen, it's not a great time right now. |
| 我的家人们来我家了  | Um, I have a little family over |
| 我能之后再回电吗  | and can I call you later? |
| 好的  抱歉啊  我也不想打扰到你们  | Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I-I don't want to interrupt. |
| 我只是有点想念你的声音了  | I just miss hearing your voice. |
| 那你现在听到啦  | Well... here it is |
| 从我喉咙产地直发出来的声音  | coming right up out of my throat. |
| 好啦  | Um, okay |
| 那...  再见啦  | so, uh, uh, bye. |
| 再见  | Bye-bye. |
| 谢尔顿怎么样了  | How's Sheldon doing? |
| -什么  -谢尔顿啊  | - What? - Sheldon. |
| 你刚才不是跟谢尔顿讲电话吗  | You were talking to Sheldon. |
| 对  对的  | Oh... right, yes. |
| 你知道他房间里有挂费曼那个人的照片吗  | Did you know he has a picture of that fella Feynman in his bedroom? |
| 真的吗  我也是啊  | What? So do I. |
| 你们简直是哥俩好  | Peas in a pod. |
| 真讨厌  | ?Oh, darn. |
| 再失陪一下  | Excuse me. |
| 谁啊  | Yes? |
| 情况怎么样了  | How's it going? |
| 谢尔顿又打来了  | It's Sheldon again. |
| 什么叫"又"打来了  | What do you mean "again"? |
| 有话快说  | Speak. |
| 我最近读了一个文章  | I recently read an article |
| 写到超导超级对撞机  | about a superconducting supercollider |
| 有可能要在德州这里建一台  | that might be built in Texas. |
| 然后呢  | What about it? |
| 我是想到如果你们  | Well, I thought if there was a lull |
| 晚餐出现没话题的场面时  | in your dinner conversation |
| 你可以不经意地说出这个来打破冷场  | you might casually drop it as an icebreaker. |
| 我们晚餐中间聊得可开心了  | Our dinner conversation is going just fine. |
| 现在你又多了一个话题储备  | Well, now you have it in your back pocket. |
| 你们继续吧  | Carry on. |
| 提问  我们今晚会有交媾行为吗  | Question-- will we be engaging in coitus tonight? |
| 因为我好像在骑车来的路上  | Because I believe I pulled a hamstring |
| 拉伤了腿筋  | on the bike ride over. |
| 那你怎么不早点说呢  | Why didn't you say something? |
| 我本来想要表现我的男子气概  | Well, I was trying to display machismo |
| 但我鼠蹊部之间的疼痛  | but it's becoming more and more clear |
| 越来越强烈地在表示我真的伤了  | that there's something askew in my groin. |
| 约翰  | Oh, John... |
| 不用你费力做什么  | we don't have to do anything. |
| 我们可以就待着啊  | We can just be together. |
| 谢谢  | Thanks. |
| 但如果你无所谓的话  | But if it's all the same to you |
| 我还是想拼一把试试看  | I'd like to give it the old college try. |
| ♪ 世上没人比我强壮 ♪  | ♪ Nobody else is stronger than I am ♪ |
| ♪ 昨天我移了一座山 ♪  | ♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪ |
| ♪ 我相信我能当你的英雄 ♪  | ♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪ |
| ♪ 我是个了不起的小家伙 ♪  | ♪ I am a mighty little man ♪ |
| ♪ 我是个了不起的小家伙 ♪  | ♪ I am a mighty little man ♪ |
| 少  | 年 |
| 给  | Here you go. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 所以你真的要  | So, you're really gonna go out |
| 一边跟这个家具店的男人好  | with this furniture store fella |
| 一边也跟斯特吉斯博士交往吗  | while seeing Dr. Sturgis? |
| 我这叫游戏人间  | It's called playing the field. |
| 如果你也像我一样玩过  | And if you'd done some of that |
| 或许你就不会跟里面那位"布鲁托"好上了  | you wouldn't be saddled with Bluto in there. |
| 这话太坏了吧  | That's not nice. |
| 而且你有必要这样吗  | And is that really necessary? |
| 意大利人把这个叫"卡瑞托[改正确]"  | The Italians call it "Corretto." |
| 意思就是把饮料给改对了  | It means correcting the drink. |
| 所以不加酒精的饮品就是错误的吗  | So, a drink without alcohol in it is wrong? |
| 没错  | Yep. |
| 意大利人可懂行了  | Italian people, they know what's up. ? |
| 行吧  你的问题一次解决一个  | All right, one issue at a time. |
| 所以你真的要脚踏两条船吗  | So, you're really gonna date two men simultaneously? |
| -你知道的只有两个  -妈  | - Two that you know of. - Oh, Mom. |
| 干嘛啦  别这么死板  | Come on, don't be such a prude. |
| 我又不会有小孩  | I'm not gonna have any babies. |
| 我也不需要这些男人养我  | I don't need these men to take care of me. |
| 我为什么不好好享受人生呢  | Why shouldn't I just enjoy myself? |
| 因为这样很对不起神啊  | Well, it isn't very Christian of you. |
| 这个我无从反驳  | I got no argument there. |
| 敬你一杯  | Salute! |
| 这饮料救回来了  | Yeah, that fixed it. |
| 姥姥  别啊  | Oh, Meemaw, no. |
| 你在打给谁  | Hey, who are you calling? |
| 斯特吉斯博士  | Dr. Sturgis. |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 我看到姥姥上了洛圣朋先生的车  | I saw Meemaw get in a car with Mr. Rosenbloom. |
| 别啊  | No... |
| 我不知道是不是真的这么发生了  | I don't know if it really happened this way |
| 但是在九岁的我的眼中  | but to my nine-year-old mind |
| 我妈当时飞起来了  | my mother was flying. |
| 这牛胸怎么样  | So, how's the brisket? |
| 不错  | It's good. |
| 虽然没我做的好吃  但还不错  | It ain't my brisket, but it's good. |
| 我应该带你去纽约  | I should take you to New York |
| 这样你就能尝到正宗的犹太牛胸肉了  | so you could taste some authentic Jewish brisket. |
| 会有什么不一样呢  | How's it different? |
| 基本上大同小异啦  | Well, it's pretty much the same except |
| 只不过是会比较多汁  而且你可以感觉到  | it's-it's a lot juicier and you can feel the fat |
| 脂肪直接往你心脏灌  | go directly to your heart. |
| 天啊  | Oh, boy... |
| 我好想念你这笑声啊  | I miss that laugh. |
| 所以...  | So, uh... |
| 你觉得这主意如何  | what do you think of that idea? |
| -什么主意  -一起去纽约  | - What idea? ?- Going to New York. |
| 或许我们还能看几个百老汇音乐剧  | Maybe we'll catch a couple of Broadway shows |
| 去看些风景  | uh, see some sights. |
| 艾拉  这个...  | Oh, Ira, gee... |
| 我不知道了  | I don't know. |
| -感觉是一大步进展  -会吗  | - Seems like a big step. ?- Is it? |
| 我觉得活到我们这个岁数了  | I think at this time of our lives |
| 我们应该多旅游  去看看世界  | we should travel, see the world. |
| -大概吧  -说到底  | - I guess. - ?I mean |
| 我们也不会越活越年轻  | we're not getting any younger. |
| 你这话是几个意思  | What's that supposed to mean? |
| 我的意思是我渐渐不年轻了  | I mean, I mean, I'm not getting any younger. |
| 但你跟我不一样  | You, on the other hand |
| 你还是朵绽放的郁金香  | you are a blossoming tulip. |
| 这还差不多  | Better. |
| 但我无法不理解  | But I still don't understand. |
| 你的外祖母是个单身女士  | Your grandmother's a single lady. |
| 她还没有跟任何一位男士定下来  | She's not committed to any one fella |
| 她想多看看自己还有那些男人可选  | and she wants to see what her options are. |
| 可是斯特吉斯博士就是最好的选择  | But Dr. Sturgis is the best option. |
| 或许你是这么觉得  | Well, you might feel that way |
| 但是她还没下定决心呢  | but she's not so sure. |
| 那我们得告诉她啊  我去打电话  | Then we need to tell her. I'll make the call. |
| 不行  我们不该多管闲事  | No. We need to mind our business |
| 我们就祈祷她会做出正确选择吧  | and maybe pray for her to make the right decision. |
| 我们要把命运交到上帝的手里吗  | We're gonna leave this up to God? |
| 你觉得你能做得比上帝更好吗  | You think you could do a better job than God? |
| 或许在创世上比不上他的  | Maybe not with creating the universe |
| 但我觉得我用一场瘟疫  | but I bet I could free the Hebrews |
| 就能在解放希伯来人上强过祂  | with one good plague. |
| 你可以在清晨3点半  | You can get lox, bagels |
| 吃到熏鲑鱼贝果加各式配料呢  | all the trimmings at 3:30 in the morning. |
| 我为什么会想要那个  | Why would I want that? |
| 的确是不会  太正餐了  | Well, you wouldn't. I mean, it's too heavy. |
| 但只要你想吃就能吃得到  | But you could if you wanted. |
| 你觉得怎么样  | So, what do you think? |
| 艾拉  我觉得不行  | Oh, Ira, I don't think so. |
| 好吧  那这样吧  | All right, what do you say |
| 去新奥尔良过一个周末如何  | to a weekend in New Orleans, huh? |
| 我们可以去坐那种高级邮轮之类的  | We could do one of those Carnival Cruise things. |
| 我要被你逼疯了  | You're killing me. |
| 我没办法  我...  | I can't do this, I... |
| 你没办法什么  | Can't do what? |
| 艾拉  你是个好人  | Ira, you're just a wonderful man. |
| 天啊  我可不喜欢你这句话的走向  | Oh, boy, I don't like where this is going. |
| 但我得跟你实话实说  | But to tell you the truth |
| 我有跟别人交往  | I'm seeing somebody else. |
| 一刀毙命  | And we've gone there. |
| 我本来想我可以做到  同时跟你们交往  | I thought I could do it, uh... you know, date both of you |
| 但我做不到  我做不来...  | but I-I can't, I can't, I just... |
| 我就不是这块料  | I'm not cut out for it. |
| 好吧  我有个提议  | Okay, suggestion. |
| 或许你可能也想过这个想法了  | And maybe you've already thought of this... |
| 你觉得你去跟那个人分手  | but what do you say you break up with him |
| 然后只跟我交往如何  | and only see me? |
| 抱歉  | I'm sorry. |
| 我以为我能承受  | I thought I could handle this. |
| -没事啦  -你知道吗  | - It's okay. - ?You know |
| 当你年纪渐长  你以为自己会脸皮更厚  | you get older, and you think your skin is thicker... |
| -没事的  -更不容易伤心  | - It's okay. - ...and your heart is tougher. |
| 但其实并不是这样  事实恰恰相反  | But it's not, it's the other way around. |
| 希望那个男的知道自己捡到什么样的宝了  | I hope this guy knows what a gift he has in you. |
| "宝"这个词有点过了吧  | Well, "gift" is a strong word |
| 但他对我很上心啦  | but he's enthusiastic. |
| 那很好  | Good. |
| 祝你们两个快快乐乐  | May you both be very happy together! |
| 我不想太快就开始庆祝  | I don't want to celebrate too soon |
| 但姥姥从洛圣朋先生车上下来  他在哭  | but Meemaw and Mr. Rosenbloom are back, and he was crying. |
| 有更新消息我会再来分享  | There'll be more updates as they happen. |
| 我吃完了  | I'm done. |
| 我能请求提早离桌吗  | Can I please be excused? |
| 天啊  你有没有嚼啊  | Good Lord, did you even chew it? |
| 没有嚼到医生建议次数  | Not the recommended amount, no. |
| 你这么着急要干嘛  | What's your hurry? |
| 我得回到我的观察位  | I need to get back to my viewing post. |
| 行  你去吧  | Fine, go ahead. |
| 他这么盯着姥姥的家是想看到什么啊  | What's he expect to see, staring at Meemaw's house? |
| 你刚进我们家吗  | Did you just join this family? |
| 那孩子就是个怪胎  | The kid's an oddball. |
| 他只是对姥姥跟一个  | He's just excited that Meemaw's dating |
| 他所敬仰的人交往而感到兴奋  | a man he looks up to. |
| 我希望她可以跟托尼·丹扎约会  那才酷呢  | I wish she could date Tony Danza-- that'd be cool. |
| 你到底是在迷托尼·丹扎哪里啊  | What is it with you and Tony Danza? |
| 虽然电视剧里没说也没演出来  | Well, the show doesn't come out and say it |
| 但我敢肯定他是老大  | but I'm pretty sure he's the boss. |
| 我觉得那金发妞才是老大  | I think the blonde lady's the boss. |
| 安琪拉吗  | Angela? |
| 现在谁才是怪胎  | Who's the oddball now? |
| 我可警告你  | I'm warning you |
| 一旦你尝了我做的烤肉  | once you try my barbecue |
| 其他人做的你再也看不上眼  | it will ruin you to all the others. |
| 这跟我当初开始用高档厕纸一样  | That's what happened to me with quilted toilet paper. |
| 一旦我试过了好东西  | Once I tried the good stuff |
| 其他用起来都像钢丝球  | everything else felt like a Brillo pad. |
| 你的比喻可真有画面感啊  | You paint quite the picture, don't you? |
| 天啊  | Oh, gosh. |
| 失陪一下  | Excuse me. |
| 谢尔顿  这可一点也不可爱了  | Sheldon, this is not cute anymore. |
| 康妮·塔克  | Connie Tucker? |
| 是我  | Yes? |
| 洛圣朋家具店的餐桌椅送到了  | I have a dinette set from Rosenbloom's Furniture. |
| 我没买家具啊  | I didn't buy any furniture. |
| 是别人送给你的礼物  | I think it's a gift. |
| 老天  | Oh, boy. |
| 我弯腰捡一本书  | I bent down to pick up a book |
| 她不趁机偷看我屁股才奇了怪呢  | and I'll be darned if she didn't sneak a look at my derriere. |
| 这家伙  | Oh, man. |
| 你们肯定不敢相信姥姥家刚发生了什么  | You won't believe what's happening at Meemaw's house. |
| 比《成长没烦恼[谁才是老大]》更有趣吗  | Is it more interesting than Who's the Boss? |
| 我深表怀疑  | Doubt it. |
| 洛圣朋家具店  我是艾拉  | Rosenbloom's Fine Furniture. Ira speaking. |
| 你为什么送家具给我  | Why are you sending me furniture? |
| 我决定不能就这么悄然离开  | I've decided I can't go away quietly. |
| 我要争取你的爱  | I'm fighting for your love. |
| 用一套餐桌椅吗  | With a dinette set? |
| 这可不是普通的餐桌椅  这是我们最热销的款式  | Oh, this isn't just any dinette set. It's our biggest seller. |
| 而且不是复合板材哦  | And it's not pressed wood-- |
| 是纯橡木的  | it's oak! |
| 艾拉  我不喜欢这样  | Ira, I don't like this. |
| 还是你更喜欢皮革面料的  | Would you prefer a leather sectional? |
| 发生什么事了  | Uh, what's going on? |
| 我晚点再打给你好吗  | Can I call you back? |
| 期待你的来电  | I look forward to it. |
| 别瞎期待  | You shouldn't. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 我猜可以这么说  | I guess you could say |
| 我其中一位前男友  | one of my former boyfriends |
| 试图用家具赢回我的心  | is trying to win me back with furniture. |
| 真厉害  | Huh. Impressive. |
| 这可是真橡木  | This is real oak. |
| 刚才电话里的是他吗  | Was that him on the phone? |
| 是的  很抱歉  | Yes. I'm sorry. |
| 有意思  | Interesting. |
| 什么  | What? |
| 知道有另一个男人跟我抢你  | Being challenged by another man |
| 你对我的吸引力立刻大增  | is making you more attractive to me. |
| 我没听懂  | I don't follow. |
| 我得做些研究  | I'll have to do some research |
| 但我猜这是遗传的本能  | but I'm guessing this is a genetic instinct |
| 让我性欲大增  | that's raising my libido. |
| 我要来一杯  | I need a drink. |
| 你们能相信他居然想用一组餐桌椅赢回我的心  | Can you believe he tried to win me back with a dinette set? |
| 如果你离开德州  我立刻送你一套餐桌椅  | I'd give you a dinette set if you'd leave Texas. |
| 那你会把东西退回去吗  | So, would you return it? |
| 当然不会  我要留着  | Hell no, I'm keeping it. |
| 可这样就等于欠人家一份情  | But then you'll be beholden to him. |
| 你有可能跟艾拉复合吗  | Would you ever take Ira back? |
| 我不知道  | I don't know. |
| 他很体贴很暖  但...  | He's sweet as he can be, but... |
| 约翰就是不一样  | there's just something about John. |
| 他就像一只可爱的小泰迪熊  | He's like a cute little teddy bear, you know? |
| 一只聪明  | A brilliant |
| 会骑自行车的  | bicycle-riding |
| 泰迪熊  | teddy bear. |
| 他说的话有一半我都听不懂  | I don't even understand half of what he says. |
| 可是...  | But... |
| 当他不在身边  我就格外想他  | when he's not around, I just miss him. |
| 听上去你恋爱了  | Sounds like you're falling in love. |
| 或许是的  | Maybe I am. |
| 太棒了  我也爱他  | Excellent. I love him, too. |
| 给我出去  | Get out of here! |
| 如果你不懂斯特吉斯博士说什么  | If you don't understand what Dr. Sturgis says |
| 我很乐意为你解释  | I'm happy to explain it to you. |
| 滚  | Get! |
| 打扰了  | Excuse me. |
| 我想找艾拉  | I'm looking for Ira. |
| 乐意为你效劳  有什么可以帮你的吗  | At your service. What can I do for you? |
| 先生  你越界了  | You, sir, have overstepped your bounds. |
| 抱歉  你说什么  | I'm sorry, what? |
| 康斯坦丝·塔克小姐  | Miss Constance Tucker |
| 曾清楚向你表示  不再接受你任何形式的求爱  | made it clear your courtship was no longer welcome |
| 而你的回应却是六张椅子  | and you responded with six chairs |
| 一张桌子和一张大活动桌板  | a table, and an expansion leaf. |
| 你算哪根葱  | Who are you? |
| 约翰·斯特吉斯  | John Sturgis |
| 她最终选择的男人  | the man she chose |
| 你的情敌  | and your romantic rival. |
| 抱歉  你找我到底想干什么  | I-I'm sorry, wait, what-what is it you want from me? |
| 我想让你放弃追求康妮  | I want you to give up your pursuit of Connie. |
| 好吧  现在请你离开我的店铺  | All right, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave my store. |
| 非常好  | Very well. |
| 分界线已划  | The line in the sand has been drawn. |
| 越界有风险  | Cross it at your own peril. |
| 怪胎  | Weirdo. |
| 你刚说什么  | What was that? |
| 你明明听见了  | You heard me. |
| 先生  我是一个有感情的人  | Sir, I am a man with feelings. |
| 你伤害到我感情了  | And you have hurt them. |
| 我知道你有过很多...  | I know you've had a number of... |
| 男性访客  | gentleman callers |
| 但我从没听你用这样的语气说起过任何一个人  | but I've never heard you speak like this before. |
| "男性访客"  | "Gentleman callers"? |
| 我们还好奇谢尔顿在哪儿学来这个词的  | And we wonder where Sheldon gets it. |
| 抱歉你们俩觉得好笑  | I'm sorry y'all find this funny |
| 但这是自从我爸去世后  | but this is the first time |
| 我妈第一次对一个男人  | my mother's expressed real interest in a man |
| 表达出有兴趣  | since Dad died. |
| 原谅我想了解更多  | Forgive me for wanting to know more. |
| 你真的想了解更多吗  | You really want to know more? |
| 想象一下你们俩都上了年纪  | Imagine you're getting on in years |
| 你和你老公准备退休  | you and your husband about to retire |
| 在萨拉索塔搞了个分时度假  | get a little timeshare in Sarasota |
| 而猝不及防  | and... suddenly... |
| 他去世了  | he's gone |
| 只留下你一个人  | and you're all alone. |
| 你忧伤你哭泣  | You mourn, you cry |
| 但最终你要往前看  | but eventually you move on. |
| 于是你开始约会  | You start dating a little |
| 发现还挺好玩  | and it's all good fun. |
| 但你内心深处总有一个声音  | But always in the back of your mind |
| 在问同一个问题  | there's that question... |
| "我会孤独终老吗"  | "Will I be alone in the end?" |
| 你们俩看我干嘛啦  | Why y'all looking at me for? |
| 我好几天没睡觉  | Haven't slept in days. |
| 感觉我就像一个为情所困的青少年  | It's like I'm a lovesick teenager |
| 除了我记得杜鲁门政府  | except I remember the Truman administration. |
| 你的感受都是可以理解  | Your feelings are understandable. |
| 康妮是一个了不起的女性  | Connie is a remarkable woman. |
| 的确  | Yes, she is. |
| 再次道歉  我不该叫你怪胎  | But, again, I'm sorry. I should never have called you weird. |
| 我知道  这很无礼  | I mean, eh, it was rude. |
| 我还有过更无礼的称呼  | I've been called much worse. |
| 一位教授称我为奇葩  | A professor once called me ostrobogulous. |
| 我还得查词典找这个词  | I had to look that one up. |
| 那是什么意思  | What's it mean? |
| 也是怪胎的意思  | That I'm a weirdo. |
| 约翰  你是一个好人  | John, you're a great guy. |
| 你也是  | Well, you, too! |
| 但我希望你明白  我只是...  | But I hope you understand, I just... |
| 我不能放弃康妮  | I can't give up on Connie. |
| 没关系  | That's all right. |
| 跟你说句实话  | To tell you the truth |
| 我发现竞争令人兴奋  | I'm finding the competition quite exhilarating. |
| 你真这么觉得吗  | You are? |
| 是的  | Oh, yes. |
| 那套餐桌椅送来的那晚  | The night the dinette set arrived |
| 我做了我40年来第一次俯卧撑  | I did my first push-up in 40 years. |
| 抱歉  但我觉得这真是...  | I'm sorry, but I find that to be, uh-- |
| 那个词是什么来着  奇八吗  | what's the word-- astro-boobulous? |
| 奇葩  | Ostrobogulous. |
| 奇葩  | Ostrobogulous. |
| 没错  | Exactly. |
| 现在给我来个最优惠的价格  | Now, give me your best price |
| 我要买一张这个  | on one of these |
| 要有杯托的哦  | with a cup holder. |
| 约翰  真是意外之喜啊  | John! What a pleasant surprise. |
| 我有件事要告诉你  | I have some news for you. |
| 什么事  | What is that? |
| 我去了家具店跟艾拉聊了聊  | I went to the furniture store and spoke to Ira. |
| 你为什么要这么做  | Why would you do that? |
| 要求他尊重你的请求  别再烦你  | To demand that he respect your wish to be left alone. |
| 约翰  你没有资格去做这种事  | John, it was not your place to do that. |
| 那这点可能安慰到你  | Well, if it helps |
| 他不打算离开你  | he doesn't plan on leaving you alone. |
| 你到底在想什么啊  | What the hell were you thinking?! |
| 我是想发挥骑士精神嘛  | That I was being chivalrous. |
| 背着我干这种事算吗  | By going behind my back? |
| 你看起来不爽啊  | You seem upset. |
| 我是不爽  | I am upset! |
| 我怎么处理艾拉是我的事  | And how I handle Ira is my business! |
| 我希望你能温柔点  | Well, I hope you do it gently. |
| 他现在非常脆弱  | He's very vulnerable these days. |
| 你们现在还成朋友了吗  | You're friends now? |
| 现在我不敢这么说  | Well, I wouldn't say friends |
| 但我可以预见  长此以往  | but I could see, over time |
| 我们很可能...  | you know, we might... |
| 你们俩是在吵架吗  | Are you two fighting? |
| 不是  | No. |
| 太好了  | Oh, good. |
| 我差点以为我们是在吵架  | I was almost certain that we were. |
| 就是  | We are. |
| -我迷糊了  -我也是  | - I'm confused. - Me, too. |
| 是因为你去家具店那件事吗  | Is this because you went to the furniture store? |
| 他也知道这事吗  | He knows about this? |
| 是的  -好了  给我听好了  | - Yes. - All right, now, listen |
| 如果这段感情还想有任何可能性  | if this relationship's gonna have any chance at all |
| 我们必须立下基本规矩  | we have to lay down some ground rules. |
| 太棒了  我爱规矩  | Great. I love rules. |
| 我也是  | I do, too. |
| 我不想你再跟他说任何  | I don't want you talking to him about anything |
| 关于我们的事情  | having to do with anything about us. |
| 你也是  | Same with you. |
| 我要你立刻停止  | And I want you to stop |
| 用你的望远镜监视我  | spying on me with those binoculars |
| 就好像你在进行什么非洲狩猎旅行一样  | like you're on some kind of African safari. |
| 你不能跟艾拉说话  | And you cannot talk to Ira |
| 或者我任何前男友你都不该去聊这个  | or any of my ex-boyfriends, for that matter. |
| 规矩越来越多  | This list is getting long. |
| 或许我们该写下来  | Maybe we should write it down. |
| 在那一刻  | In that moment |
| 我突然顿悟  | I had an epiphany. |
| 我可以为任何社交关系拟订合同  | I could draw up a contract for any social relationship. |
| 在这个经常讲不清道不明的世界里  | It was a helpful way to remove ambiguity |
| 这是一种消除模棱两可的话的有效方式  | in a world that was often hard to understand. |
| 条目三  | Article three-- |
| 谢尔顿不准  | Sheldon will not spy |
| 用望远镜监视姥姥家  | on Meemaw's house with binoculars. |
| 这句话给我加粗  | Type that one in bold. |
| 请签上姓名和日期  | Please sign and date. |
| 谢尔顿  如果有帮助的话  我还有公证人资格  | You know, Sheldon, I'm a notary, if that helps. |
| 你在我心目中的形象变得更酷了  | Just when I thought you couldn't get cooler. |
| 我决定  | I would go on |
| 这辈子都会继续拟定合同的行为  | to draw up such contracts throughout my life-- |
| 无论是跟室友  | with roommates |
| 还是妻子  | with my wife. |
| 甚至是跟我的孩子们  | Even with my own children. |
