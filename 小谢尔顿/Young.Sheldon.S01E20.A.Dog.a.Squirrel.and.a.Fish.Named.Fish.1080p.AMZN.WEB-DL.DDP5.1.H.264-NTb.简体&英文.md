| 穿好衣服  测试重力加速度  | get dressed and test that acceleration due to gravity |
| 并不受物体的移动影响的早晨  | does not depend on an object's motion. |

| 乔治  你没看到有只狗  | Hey, George. Uh, you didn't see a dog |
| 跑来你家这溜达吧  | wandering around here, did you? |
| 没啊  你们养狗啦  | No. Y'all get a dog? |
| 算吧  我大舅子要搬去有栅栏社区  | Uh, sort of. We took him in after my brother-in-law |
| 我们就收养了这条狗  | had to go live in a gated community. |
| 感觉不错啊  他们那里禁养宠物吗  | Oh, that sounds nice; uh, they got a no pets policy? |
| 是去坐牢  乔治  | He's in jail, George. |
| 好吧  行  | Right, sure. |

| 蓝爷爷独特的拐杖  | Grandpa Smurf's unique walking stick. |
| 蓝精灵哟喂呀  | Smurf-a-loo-loo. |
| 那不是我的拐杖  | That's not my walking stick. |
| 午餐好了  | Lunch is ready. |

| 快去  | Just go. |
| 这家里什么都他蓝精灵的要我干  | I have to do smurfing everything around here. |
| 我听到了  | I heard that. |

| 我听到了你用这词的方式  | And I heard how you said it. |
| 她自己给自己吐司切边吧  | She can cut her own crusts off. |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon? |
| 你是谁呀  | Who are you? |
| 你真可爱  | You're so cute. |
| 小心点  | Be careful. |
| 你躲在那上面干嘛  | What are you doing up there? |
| 保护性命  | Staying alive. |
| 这是谁的狗啊  | Whose dog is this? |
| 我不知道  快叫人来救命  | I don't know. Get help. |
| 它怎么进我们车库的  | Well, how did he get into the garage? |
| 快请你去找人来救命  | Please get help. |
| 或许我们可以收养它  | Maybe we can keep it. |
| 我求你了  快去找人来  | I'm begging you, get help now. |
| 首先  我得告诉你一件事  | First, I have to tell you something. |
| 什么  | What? |
| 午餐好了  | Lunch is ready. |
| 你看看  | Will you look at that? |
| 什么狗会咬穿木头啊  | What kind of dog chews through wood? |
| 你们都有喂它吧  | Y'all are feeding him, right? |
| 或许它是在磨牙  | Maybe he's teething. |
| 比利小的时候  | You know, when Billy was little, |
| 他咬穿了他的围栏  | he chewed right through his playpen. |
| -真的假的  -他只有三颗牙  | - No kidding? - Only had three teeth. |
| 基本都是靠牙龈咬的  | Mostly gummed it. |
| 所以你们打算怎么处理  | So how y'all want to fix it? |
| 我想我可以把这里补上  | Well, I figure I'll patch it, |
| 然后用细铁丝网围住下面这块  | run some chicken wire along the bottom-- |
| 这样它就不能再来咬穿个洞了  | that way, he don't chew through it again. |
| 你们好  | Hello. |
| -你好  -你好啊  比利  | - Hey. - ‭Hey, Billy. |
| 以前这里就有个围栏窗口了吗  | Was this fence window always here? |
| 不是的儿子  这围栏窗口是新的  | No, son, that's a new fence window. |
| 有人感觉头晕吗  | Anybody else getting dizzy? |
| 你怎么不叫人救你呢  | Why didn't you call for help? |
| 我试过了  但我发不出声音  | I tried, but no sound came out. |
| 可怜的孩子  | You poor thing. |
| 车库上面好脏啊  | It was very dirty up there. |
| 打扫车库是你还是爸爸的责任  | Is cleaning the garage your job or Dad's? |
| 你不用担心那个  | Don't you worry about that. |
| 来  喝点茶  | Here, have some tea. |
| -甘菊茶吗  -是的  | - Chamomile? ‭- Yes. |
| 加一茶匙的蜂蜜了吗  | One teaspoon of honey? |
| 加了  | Yes. |
| 加了一块冰块来降温了吗  | An ice cube to cool it off? |
| 我给你加了两块  | I went with two today. |
| 你今天过得太惨了  | You've been through enough. |
| 我还是比较喜欢加一块冰  | I prefer one ice cube. |
| 快给老娘喝了  | Drink it. |
| 孩子们都上床了之后真好  | It's nice when the kids are in bed, |
| 我们可以就在这放松聚着  | and we can just hang out and relax. |
| 你这话我连回都懒得回  | I'm not even gonna respond to that. |
| 终于把他哄睡了  | I finally got him asleep. |
| 他现在还惊魂未定  | He's still pretty shook up. |
| 或许隔壁养这条狗也不是什么坏事  | Maybe having this mutt next door won't be so bad. |
| 谢利说不定哪天就能习惯了  | Shelly could end up getting used to it. |
| 这倒是真的  | That's true. |
| 还记得他以前总因为  | Remember when he got all freaked out |
| 酸奶底下的水果而小题大做吗  | by the fruit at the bottom of yogurt? |
| 他现在也能正常吃了  | Now he eats it no problem. |
| 他现在也还是要我帮他搅好啊  | He still makes me stir it. |
| 或许他可以一步步来  | Maybe you could start out |
| 先从小动物开始  再慢慢适应大的  | with a small pet, and work your way up. |
| 比如小乌龟  | Like a turtle. |
| 他说乌龟带有沙门氏菌  | He says they carry salmonella. |
| 沙鼠呢  | A gerbil? |
| 黑死病的真正元凶好像是它们  | Apparently, they caused the plague. |
| 那鸟呢  | What about a bird? |
| 这题我来答  | Oh, I know that one. |
| 它们会偷他的头发去筑巢  | They'll steal his hair to make a nest. |
| 妈  | Mom! |
| 至少这次我能发出声音了  | At least this time, sound came out. |
| 我觉得这算是进步  | I call that progress. |
| 怎么了  | What's going on? |
| 你家的狗跑进我家里了  | Your dog got into our house. |
| 它怎么进去的  | How the hell did he do that? |
| 它把纱窗给推开了  | He pushed in a screen window. |
| 你觉得它是不是又把围栏咬穿了  | You think he chewed through the fence again? |
| 我只知道谢尔顿对着这狗吼  | All I know is Sheldon's yelling at the dog, |
| 然后玛丽就吼我  | and Mary's yelling at me. |
| 而我现在在这看着你穿着内裤  | Now I'm looking at you in your underwear. |
| 要命了  赫谢尔  怎么了  | Damn it, Herschel, what is going on? |
| 你好啊  乔治  | Oh, hey, George. |
| 你好啊  布兰达  | Hey, Brenda. |
| 巴基跑进他们家里了  | Bucky got in their house. |
| 这还挺好笑  | That's funny. |
| 或许哪天回忆起来挺好笑  但现在不好笑  | It might be funny one day, not right now. |
| 真的很抱歉啦  乔治  | Look, I'm real sorry, George. |
| 我会把它拴上  下次不会这样了  | I'll keep him tied up, it won't happen again. |
| 你们晚安  | Y'all have a good night. |
| 乔治  | George! |
| 你绝对不敢相信  你看  | You are not gonna believe this. Look. |
| 他们的狗留了一只死松鼠在我们客厅  | Their dog left a dead squirrel in our living room. |
| 它有猎狗的血统  | Well, h-he is part hunting dog. |
| 我想这表示它喜欢你们  | I think that means he likes you. |
| 我对它的喜爱没有兴趣  | I'm not interested in winning his affection. |
| 我只对不让狗与啮齿动物进我家有兴趣  | I'm interested in keeping dogs and rodents outside of my home. |
| 等等    | Well, now, hold on. |
| 你怎么知道是巴基  | How do we know it was Bucky that left |
| 把这只松鼠留在你家的  | that squirrel in your house? |
| 或许这松鼠本来就在那里了啊  | Maybe that squirrel was already there. |
| 除了它  我家客厅怎么可能会有死松鼠  | Why else would a dead squirrel be in my living room? |
| 我哪知道你怎么打理你家的  | I don't know what kind of house you keep. |
| 我家一尘不染  | My house is immaculate. |
| 乔治  你告诉他们  | George, tell them. ‭Uh... |
| 他的确把家里打理得很好  | She does keep a nice house. |
| 亲爱的  的确很可能是巴基留下的  | Honey, it's a pretty good chance it was Bucky. |
| -你站谁那边  -你的  永远你这边  | - Whose side are you on? - Yours, always yours. |
| 好啦  现在大家情绪都不好  时间也晚了  | All right. Everyone's upset, it's late. |
| 我们今晚这事就先缓缓吧  | Maybe we should drop this for tonight? |
| 好主意  好啦  | That's a good idea. Okay. |
| 你把你家狗关得离我儿子远点  | You just keep your dog away from my son. |
| -你又重启战火啦  -抱歉  | - There you go picking it up again. - I am sorry, |
| 但是他们家的狗偷闯进我们家  | but their dog broke into our home. |
| 或许是跟她哥哥学的  | Something he probably learned from your brother. |
| 你好大的胆子  | How dare you. |
| 好了  我觉得在这里停下挺好的  | Okay, I think that's a good stopping point. |
| 我们怎么知道不是你儿子  | How do we know that your son didn't |
| 引诱巴基  想在狗身上做什么奇怪的科学实验  | lure Bucky in to perform weird science experiments on him? |
| 我儿子当时已经上床睡了  你好大的胆子...  | My son was asleep in his bed, and you have some nerve... |
| 晚安啦  乔治  | Night, George! |
| 晚安  | Night! |
| 我真不懂那条狗  | I don't understand why that dog |
| 对谢尔顿这么感兴趣  | is so interested in Sheldon. |
| 或许巴基喜欢谢尔顿的味道  | Maybe Bucky likes the way Sheldon smells? |
| 你弟弟一天洗三次澡  | Your brother washes himself three times a day. |
| 他没有味道  | He has no smell. |
| 找到了  动物管理局  | Here we go: animal control. |
| 别  别  | Oh, no, no. |
| 不行  你怎么可以打给动物管理局呢  | No, you don't want to go calling animal control. |
| -为什么不行  -因为  | - Why not? - ‭Because, |
| 你还得住在这些人的隔壁呢  | you have to live next door to these people. |
| 小乔治音乐放太大声他们也打给警察了啊  | They called the cops on Georgie when he played music too loud. |
| 或许是他们  也可能是我  | Maybe it was them, maybe it was me. |
| 但重点是  | Anyway, the point is, |
| 你想灭火就不能火上浇油啊  | you don't can't go throwing gasoline on the fire. |
| 是他们自己放的火  | Well, they started this fire, |
| 现在准备引火自焚吧  | and now, they're gonna get burned. |
| 我觉得你咖啡喝够多了  再喝上脑  | I believe you've had enough coffee. |
| 我说  要不你让我去跟布兰达谈吧  | Listen, why don't you let me talk to Brenda, |
| 让我来摆平这件事  | and just smooth things out? |
| 你凭什么觉得她会听你的话  | Why do you think she'll listen to you? |
| 因为人们喜欢我多过喜欢你啊  | Because people like me more than you. |
| 大家喜欢我啊  | People like me. |
| 我没说别人不喜欢你  只说更喜欢我  | I didn't say they don't, they just like me more. |
| 总之  我整天在保龄球馆遇见她  | Anyway, I see her all the time at bowling. |
| 我知道怎么跟她相处  | I know how to handle her. |
| 行  | Fine. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 很多人都喜欢我好吗  | Plenty of people like me. |
| 布兰达  最近好吗  | Hey, Brenda, how's it going? |
| 你女儿烦人得要死  你说好不好  | Your daughter's a pain in my ass, that's how it's going. |
| 你还真是明人不说暗话啊  | You don't beat around the bush. |
| 我一直都喜欢你这点  | I've always liked that about you. |
| 康妮  我今晚上班够累了  | Connie, I've had a long night. |
| 除非你是想打球  不然我懒得听你废话  | Unless you're looking to bowl, I don't want to hear it. |
| 来嘛  别这样  | Aw, now, come on. |
| 让我请你喝杯酒  咱们来聊两句  | Let me buy you a drink, and we'll talk about this. |
| 我比你想象中更支持你呢  | I'm more on your side than you think. |
| -我莫名不太敢信呢  -是真的  | - Somehow, i doubt that. - ‭It's true. |
| 你以为我就没觉得玛丽有时候是个...  | Don't you think I realize that Mary can be a bit... |
| 自以为是的臭婊子吗  | Of a self-righteous bitch? |
| 我本来要说"难相处"  但你这么说也可以  | I was gonna say "challenging," but sure, let's go with yours. |
| 说起来挺顺口的  | It's got a nice rhythm. |
| 布兰达  这不得不说  | Brenda, this is, by far, |
| 是我们这里保龄球馆中最好喝的玛格丽塔了  | the best bowling alley margarita in town. |
| 你跟赫谢尔结婚多少年了  18  19年了吗  | How long you and Herschel been married? 18, 19 years? |
| 19年  感觉像30年了  | 19, but it feels like 30. |
| 你们也算是神仙眷侣啦  | Well, y'all are a great couple. |
| 我是想谢谢你  | I just wanted to thank you |
| 从我女儿跟她一家人搬过来之后  | for being so patient and kind to my daughter and her family |
| 就对他们包容又友善  | since they moved in. |
| -这没什么  -不  我得说出来  | - It's nothing. - ‭No, it needs to be said. |
| 玛丽养育那三个孩子很不容易  | You know, Mary has a tough job raising those three kids, |
| 尤其其中一个还挺...特别的  | with one of them being, you know, somewhat special. |
| -我能理解  -是啊  | - I can see that. ‭- Yeah. |
| 有友善的邻居让一切都好多了  | And having a kind neighbor makes all the difference in the world. |
| 我们尽力而为  | Well, we try. |
| 我知道你也很清楚压力有多大  | And I know you know how stressful it is, |
| 因为你也有一个  | seeing as how you have your own child |
| 很特别的儿子  | who is special in his own way. |
| 这话是什么意思  | What's that supposed to mean? |
| 我知道比利是个很棒的孩子  | Well, I mean, hey, I know Billy is a terrific little boy, |
| 但他一定给你和赫谢尔带来过  | but I am sure he has presented you and Herschel |
| 不少挑战  | with some challenges. |
| 要说我们这区有哪个孩子怪异  | If there's a weird kid in the neighborhood, |
| 一定是你的外孙  | it's your grandson. |
| 等一下  我说的是"特别"  不是"怪异"  | Now, hang on, I said "special," not "weird." |
| 我听到了  | I heard you. |
| 我说的是"怪异"  | I said "weird." |
| 知道吗  布兰达  | Okay, see now, Brenda, |
| 劝你不要说我外孙"怪异"  | you don't want to go calling my grandson weird |
| 因为我刚刚才请你喝了玛格丽塔酒  | when I've just treated you to a margarita grande. |
| 不好意思  但你也不该暗示  | Well, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't be inferring |
| 我家比利有毛病  | there's something wrong with my Billy. |
| 亲  这不是暗示  | Darlin', there's no inferring. |
| 我见过你儿子坐在泥地上  | I've seen the boy sitting in the dirt |
| 吃他肚脐里的棉絮团  | eating his own belly button lint. |
| 真的吗  妈妈  你就是这样灭火的  | Really, Mom? This is how you put out the fire? |
| 至少她伤得比较重  | Well, at least she got the worst of it. |
| 你怎么得出这结论的  | How you figure that? |
| 我把她一大片头发给扯下来了  | I ripped a big patch of hair out of her head. |
| 这淤青一周就会好  | This will be healed in a week. |
| 而她到劳动节前都得戴帽子遮丑  | She will be wearing a hat till Labor Day. |
| 我长大后要像你一样  | I want to be just like you when I grow up. |
| -不行  -三思啊  | - No, you don't. - ‭Pick again. |
| 请问一下  哈钦斯老师  | Excuse me, Ms. Hutchins? |
| 谢尔顿好啊  | Hey, Sheldon. |
| 你能推荐克服恐惧的书吗  | Can you recommend any books on overcoming phobias? |
| 那些都在自助书籍区  | That's in the self-help section. |
| 跟我来  我全都看过  | Follow me, I have read them all. |
| -有特指哪种恐惧吗  -狗  | - Any phobia in particular? ‭- Dogs. |
| 恐犬病  这个不错  | Ah, cynophobia. That's a good one. |
| 你知道光在美国  | Did you know there's over 50 million dogs |
| 就有超过5千万只狗吗  | just in the United States alone? |
| 多余了5千万只狗  | That's 50 million too many. |
| 给  我读这本来改善我的接触恐惧症  | Here. I read this one to help with my haphephobia. |
| 害怕被碰触  我也有这病症  有用吗  | Ah, fear of being touched. I have that, too. Was it useful? |
| 等有人有兴趣碰我时  | Well, when someone's interested in touching me, |
| 就知道了  | we'll find out. |
| 这本书的基本前提是  | The basic premise of the book was that phobias |
| 想克服恐惧  | were overcome by taking incremental steps |
| 必须逐步面对该恐惧  | toward confronting the phobia in question. |
| 对我而言  就是从看一个  | In my case, that started with watching a TV show |
| 全天下小朋友都喜欢  | that was adored by children around the world, |
| 但于我如同噩梦的电视节目开始  | but for me, was the stuff of nightmares. |
| 史酷比  | Scooby-Doo! |
| 下一步就是跟真正的狗  | The next step was to go face-to-face |
| 面对面  | with real dogs. |
| 虽然是透过一扇玻璃窗  | Albeit through a plate-glass window. |
| 够了够了  | Okay, that's enough. |
| 最后  | And finally, |
| 第三种近距离接触  | a close encounter of the third kind, |
| 与一种犬科动物进行身体接触  | physical contact with a member of the canine species. |
| 你好  我想找兽医  | Hello, I'd like to speak with the veterinarian. |
| 我希望你有一两只处于麻醉状态的狗  | Well, I was hoping you might have one or two dogs |
| 能让我来摸一下  | under anesthesia that I might come by and pet. |
| 好的  我等着  | Sure, I'll hold. |
| 你在跟谁打电话  | Who are you talking to? |
| 梅福德兽医诊所  | The Medford Veterinary Clinic. |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 我想克服我对狗的恐惧  | I'm trying to overcome my fear of dogs |
| 不然我们家还得受更大影响  | before it affects our family any further. |
| 宝贝  你不必担心我们会受影响  | Oh, honey, you don't have to worry about how it affects us. |
| 姥姥脸上被揍了一拳  都是因为我  | Meemaw got punched in the face because of me. |
| 不  那不是你造成的  再说了  | No, that wasn't because of you, and for the record, |
| 你姥姥脸上经常挨揍啊  | your meemaw gets punched in the face all the time. |
| 我仍然认为我需要  | Well, I still think I need to take |
| 采取一些积极行动  | some sort of positive action. |
| -喂  -喂  你好  | - Hello? - Yes, hello? |
| 真不幸  | Oh, that's too bad. |
| 那有最近老死的蓬毛小型犬吗  | How about a small fluffy one that's recently died of old age? |
| 够了  | Enough. |
| 抱歉  | Sorry. |
| 《马可福音》12章31节说到  | Now, it says here in Mark 12:31 |
| "要爱邻如己"  | that you should "Love your neighbor as yourself." |
| 有人想猜猜这是什么意思吗  米希  | Anybody like to take a guess what that means? Missy? |
| 意思是要对邻居友善  | It means to be nice to the people who live next door. |
| 没错  | That's right. |
| 至于剩下的人就都下地狱去吧  | But everybody else can go to hell. |
| 米希  我们这儿不能说这种话  | Okay, Missy, we don't use that kind of language here. |
| 如果仔细想想  在现在这个时代  | And if you think about it, in this world, |
| 我们有那么多旅行方式  所有人都是你的邻居  | with all the ways we can travel, everybody's your neighbor. |
| 谢尔顿  | Yes, Sheldon. |
| 我们的妈妈互相讨厌  | How do we love our neighbors |
| 我们又如何爱自己的邻居呢  | when our moms hate each other? |
| -你妈妈讨厌谁  -你妈妈  | - Who does your mom hate? - Your mom. |
| 我妈妈也讨厌你妈妈  好巧哦  | Hey, my mom hates your mom. Small world. |
| 好了  先等一下  | Okay, let's hang on a second. |
| 我妈妈也讨厌他们的姥姥  | My mom also hates their grandma. |
| 因为她打架输给她了  | 'Cause she lost a fight to her. |
| 才不  她赢了  她说的  | Nuh-uh, she won. She said so. |
| 好了  都别说了  | All right, stop. Let's stop. |
| 这也许难以理解  | Now this might be hard to understand, |
| 但过充满爱的基督徒生活  | but living a loving, Christian life |
| 并非易事  | isn't always the easiest thing to do. |
| 比利  | Yes, Billy. |
| 我妈妈也不太喜欢你  | My mom's not crazy about you either. |
| 爱你们的邻居  好吗  | Just love your neighbor, 'kay? |
| 我的教区居民之间关系不好  | Now, I am more than willing to look the other way |
| 我很愿意睁只眼闭只眼  | when my parishioners don't get along with each other. |
| 这是常有的事  但如果问题影响到孩子  | That sort of thing happens, but when it becomes a problem |
| 我就得插手了  | for the children, then I have to intervene. |
| 根本没问题  | There's no problem here, |
| 只除了这俩人觉得自己比我强  | other than these two thinking that they're better than me. |
| 我不是觉得  我知道  | I don't think it, I know it. |
| 我狠揍了你妈一顿  | I gave your mother a good smacking. |
| 我也可以让你尝尝厉害  | I can give you one, too. |
| 头发横着梳掩饰秃头的人也好意思说  | That's big talk from somebody with a comb-over. |
| 女士们  | Ladies. |
| 我需要提醒你们  我们都是基督徒吗  | Do I need to remind you that we are Christians? |
| 在我们所有的行为行动中  | In all our behavior, in all our actions, |
| 我们都必须不断扪心自问  | we must constantly ask ourselves the question, |
| "耶稣会怎么做"  | "What would Jesus do?" |
| 我能说几句吗  | Can I say something? |
| 耶稣会说那些吗  | Would Jesus say it? |
| 算了  | Never mind. |
| 在我人生中  | In my life, |
| 我常被说是行动上的懦夫  | I've often been accused of being a physical coward, |
| 大部分时候  这说法是对的  | and for the most part, those accusations are correct. |
| 但我也曾数次表现出巨大的勇气  | But there have been times when I've shown great courage. |
| 这就是其中一次  | This was one of them. |
| 巴基你好啊  | Hello, Bucky. |
| 你是乖狗狗吗  | Are you a good dog? |
| 拜托你乖乖的  | Please be a good dog. |
| 拜托了  | Please. |
| 很多时候  我们不喜欢别人  | Now oftentimes, when we don't like someone, |
| 是因为看到他们身上有我们自身也有  | what's happening is we see something in them |
| 且不喜欢的的缺点  | that we don't like in ourselves. |
| 你在说什么  | What are you saying? |
| 不是吧  你这都听不懂  | Really? That was over your head? |
| 我是说  | I'm saying, |
| 你们也许比想象中有更多共同点  | y'all might have more in common than you think. |
| 千万别说他们的孩子都很"特别"  | Well, don't say both their kids are "special." |
| 她可不喜欢听这话  | She does not like that. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 来吧  | Here we go. |
| 抚摸...狗狗  | Petting... the dog. |
| 我做到了  | I'm doing it. |
| 我在摸狗狗  | I'm petting a dog. |
| 我战胜了我的恐惧  | I've conquered my phobia. |
| 你是只乖狗狗  你就是  | You're a good boy. Yes, you are. |
| 抱歉我对你说了那些恶毒话  | I'm sorry for the unkind things I said to you. |
| 我也是  | Me, too. |
| 康妮  | Connie? |
| 干嘛  | What? |
| 你有话想说吗  | Anything you'd like to say? |
| 并没有  | Not particularly. |
