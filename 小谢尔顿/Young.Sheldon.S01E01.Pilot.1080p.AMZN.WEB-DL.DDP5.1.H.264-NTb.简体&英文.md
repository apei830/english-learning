| 证明牛顿第一定律...  | to prove Newton's first law-- |
| 任何物体都要保持  | an object in motion stays in motion |
| 匀速直线运动或静止状态  | with the same speed and in the same direction |
| 直到外力迫使它改变运动状态为止  | unless acted upon by an unbalanced force-- |
| 我感到了尼尔·阿姆斯特朗登月时  | I felt like Neil Armstrong on the moon, |
| 那孤独又快乐的感觉  | alone and happy. |
| 谢利  晚饭做好了  | Shelly, dinner's ready! |
| 我不管你有多笨  | I don't care how dimwitted you are. |

| 当然  我1989年在德州东部  | Of course, nobody I knew in East Texas |
| 所认识的人中  没人在乎牛顿物理学  | in 1989 cared about Newtonian physics. |
| 他们唯一在意的"牛顿"  | The only Newtons they cared about |
| 是艺人维恩·牛顿与牛顿饼干  | were Wayne and Fig. |
| 谢尔顿  你再不来  | Sheldon, if you don't get in here, |
| -我就去舔你的牙刷  -马上来  | I'm gonna lick your toothbrush! Coming! |

| 够了  | That's enough. |
| 没人是被领养的  | No one's adopted. |
| 真希望我是  | I wish I was. |
| 我还能让别人领养你  | That can still be arranged. |
| 来祷告吧  | Now, let's pray. |
| 稍等一下  | A moment, please. |
| -随他去  -他为什么不能跟家人握手  | - Leave him be. - He can hold hands with his family. |

| 乔治  你吃晚饭前洗手了吗  | Georgie, did you wash your hands before dinner? |
| 或者说  你这周有洗手过吗  | Or even this week? |
| 关你屁事啊  | None of your business. |

| 当我想到他要跟我读同一年级  | How can I be excited when he's gonna be |
| 我就兴奋不起来  | in the same grade as me? |
| 别担心  乔治  我没打算  | Don't worry, Georgie, I'm not planning |
| 要在高一读太久  | on being in the ninth grade for very long. |
| 反正他不再跟我读同一年级  | All I know is he's not in the same grade as me anymore, |
| 我可高兴坏了  | and I'm thrilled. |
| 祝你上课玩手指画  玩得开心  | Good luck with your finger painting. |

| 我得去学习战术手册  | I got to study my playbook. |
| 我陪你去吧  妈妈  | I'll go with you, Mom. |
| 你为什么去  | Why are you going? |
| 你都不信上帝  | You don't believe in God. |
| 不啊  但是我信妈妈  | No, but I believe in Mom. |
| 总比不去好  米希  | I'll take it. Missy? |
| 去不了  希瑟找我去...  | Can't, Heather asked me to... |
| -你得去  -操他妈的  | - You're goin'. - Son of a bitch. |

| 你的心里有恶念吗  | Do you have evil thoughts? |
| 我只是觉得这一段我用不上  | I just don't think this part applies to me. |
| 没关系  安静听讲就行了  | That's fine. Be quiet and listen. |
| 我才九岁  | I'm only nine years old. |
| 大多数恶念要等青春期才产生  | Most evil doesn't start till puberty. |
| 您好  | Hello. |
| 你有恶念吗  | Do you have evil thoughts? |

| 她是为了安慰你才这么说  | She just said that to make you feel better. |
| 妈妈才不说谎  | Mom doesn't lie. |
| 的确  她相信地球是上帝花六天做成  | Sure, she thinks the Earth was made in six days, |
| 但她只是好骗  而不是个骗子  | but that's 'cause she's gullible, not a liar. |
| 妈妈  | Mom, |

| 不只是谢尔顿  | It's not just Sheldon. |
| 乔治会跟他是同班同学呢  | Georgie's gonna be in class with him. |
| 不在浴室  | Not in the bathroom! |
| 拿来  | Give it. |
| 你想玩一个车上游戏吗  | Would you like to play a driving game? |
| 不太想  我总是输  | Not really. I always lose. |

| 好的  | Very well. |
| 你明白学校里会有人因为你太聪明  | You understand that some people are gonna be intimidated by you |
| 而感到威胁吧  | 'cause of how smart you are? |
| 他们也有可能会认可我的聪明才智  | Or maybe they'll recognize my intellect |
| 进而推选我当他们的领导  | and make me their leader. |
| 主啊  请保佑我的孩子  | Lord, look after my son. |
| 保佑他不被人塞进运动包里  | Don't let him get stuffed in a gym bag. |
| 天啊  | Oh, dear. |
| 那男生有个露出的刺青  | That boy has an exposed tattoo. |
| 是啊  | He does. |
| 不知道他知不知道  | I wonder if he knows |
| 那样违反着装规范  | that's in violation of the dress code. |
| 说到这个  | Speaking of which, |
| 咱们别戴领结了好吗  | how about we lose the bowtie? |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 亲爱的  你看大家  没人戴领结啊  | Look around, honey. None of the other kids are wearing one. |
| 或许我可以引领潮流啊  | Well, perhaps I'll start a fad. |

| 祝你今天一切顺利  | You have a good day. |
| 我放学后会来接你  | And I'll pick you up after school, |
| 就在我们进来的那个出口等你  | same door we came in. |
| 你是哭了还是过敏犯了  | Are you crying or having an allergy attack? |
| 过敏  | Allergies. |

| 这个男生在规定范围外  | this boy is wearing sports attire |
| 穿着运动服饰  | outside of a designated area |
| 这个女生的上衣太透  | and this girl's blouse is diaphanous, |
| 这表示我能看到底下的胸罩  | which means I can see her brassiere. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 我会再参考你的意见  | I will take that into account. |
| 好  | All right. |
| 在第一堂课开始前还有几分钟  | We have a few minutes before first period. |

| 第5章B小段  | article five, subsection B, |
| 您有一点小胡须  | you have a bit of a mustache. |

| 他就开始质疑我的文凭  | he questioned my credentials. |
| 一个孩子质疑我违反了卫生条例的情况下  | How am I supposed to control a classroom when a kid accuses me |
| 我还怎么管住一个班  | of being in breach of the hygiene code? |
| 休伯特  你多洗洗澡也不会死啊  | Well, Hubert, it wouldn't kill you to shower a little more often. |
| 乔治  你想说两句吗  | George, you want to weigh in here? |
| 奥洛尔罗伯茨大学是一所好大学  | Oral Roberts University is a wonderful school. |

| 祝你们的谢尔顿在别的学校...  | We wish you luck with Sheldon elsewhere... |
| 不不不  | No, no, no. |
| 我们的别无选择  | We don't have a choice. |
| 是他只能在这里读书了  | He's got to stay here. |
| 我们负担不起私立学校  | We can't afford private school. |
| 我也没办法在家教他  | I sure can't homeschool him. |
| 他已经在做微积分跟欧几里得什么的了  | He's doing calculus and Euclidean something or other. |
| 欧几里得几何学  | Euclidean geometry. |
| 猜猜我在哪学到的这个  | Guess where I learned that. |

| 我唯一在乎的就是  | All I care about is that |
| 我儿子得到了他应得的教育  | my son gets the education he deserves, |
| 所以你们这些老师得想办法  | so you all are gonna have to figure this out. |
| 教练  你能帮我说两句吗  | Coach, can you help me out here, please? |

| 你也没什么别的选择了  | Well, I don't see what choice you have. |
| 是啊  从他会说话开始  我再也没选择了  | Right. Ever since he could talk, I quit having any choices. |
| 我知道这很难  | I know it's hard. |
| 但以你的教练身份告诉你  少唧唧歪歪了  | I'm telling you, as your coach, quit your whining, |
| 穿上你的制服  快滚回去继续练习  | get your uniform on and you get your ass back out there. |
| 那以我父亲的身份呢  | But what about as my dad? |

| 为什么不能看卡通《唐老鸭俱乐部》  | Why can't we watch DuckTales? |
| 因为看那卡通学不到东西  | 'Cause we don't learn anything watching DuckTales. |
| 是看电视  本来就不应该学东西  | It's TV; we aren't supposed to learn. |
| 两个鳄鱼夹  还有  我看看...  | ...two alligator grips and, let's see... |
