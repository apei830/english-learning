| 等会就知道了  | We'll find out. |
| 我现在有事了  | I'm not all right anymore! |
| 大家开电筒  | Flashlights, guys! |
| 万一龙卷风击中我们  我们全死了怎么办  | What if it hits us and we all die? |
| 不会击中我们的  我倒有可能暴打你  | It's not gonna hit us! I might hit you. |
| 但我会先抱住你  | But first, I'm gonna hold you. |

| 你只是担心我可能得搬过来跟你们住  | You were just worried I might have to come live with you. |
| 我想你要说的不是"担心"是"害怕"  | Oh, I think the word you're looking for is "terrified." |
| 我过去看看吧  | Hmm. Better go check on it. |
| 我陪你一起去  | I'll come with you. |
| 小心点  | Be careful. |
| 妈妈  | Mom? |
| 什么  宝贝  | Yeah, baby? |
| 你不会相信我刚才撒的尿有多大泡  | You would not believe the pee I just took. |
