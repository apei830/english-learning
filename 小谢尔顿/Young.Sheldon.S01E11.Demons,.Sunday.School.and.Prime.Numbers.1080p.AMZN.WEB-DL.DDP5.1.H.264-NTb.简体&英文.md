| 我真的很担心  | I'm worried. |
| 这书里面有能召唤真正恶魔的咒语  | There are incantations in this book to summon actual demons. |
| 怪不得我们身边有这位恶魔  | Is that how we wound up with you? |
| 蛮好笑的  所以我饶你一命  | That's a good one. I'm gonna give you that. |
| 不要不当回事  | This is not a joke. |
| 这就是教会里有警告过的  | This is one of the children's games |
| 那种不恰当的小孩游戏  | we were warned about in church. |
| 那就跟他说不许玩啊  | Then tell him to stop playing. |
| 哪有这么简单  | It's not that easy. |
| 他好不容易交了几个朋友  | He's finally got a couple of friends. |
| 我不想吓跑他朋友  | I don't want to scare them off. |
| 等哪天你想吓跑小朋友时  | Well, when you're ready to scare kids, |
| 这张吓人脸随时恭候差遣  | you got this face locked and loaded. |
| 够了  上一个还蛮好笑的  | All right, the other one was funny, |
| 这一个就只是你在嘴贱  | now you're just being a jackass. |
| 你们俩玩得高兴我很开心  | I'm glad you're both amused, |
| 但我们的宝贝儿子的灵魂可能有危险呢  | but our little boy's soul may be at stake. |
| 拜托  | Come on. |
| 我小时候我也听了很多黑色安息日乐队  | When I was a kid, we were listening to Black Sabbath, |
| 他们唱了一堆恶魔有关的歌  | all that devil music. |
| 我也平安无事啊  | Didn't hurt me. |
| 撒旦也没来收割我的灵魂  | Satan didn't get my soul. |
| 那你灵魂上哪去了  拿去换甜甜圈吃了吗  | What happened to it? You trade it for some donuts? |
| 你自找的  | You had that one coming. |
| 你好  斯巴克斯先生  | Hello? Mr. Sparks? |
| -你好啊 玛丽  -现在有空吗  | - Oh, hello, Mary. - Got a minute? |
| 有啊  什么事  | Sure, what's up? |
| 我有点担心孩子们玩的一个游戏  | Um, I was just concerned about a game that the boys were playing |
| 不晓得你们夫妇知不知道这个事情  | and was wondering if you and your wife knew about it. |
| 游戏吗  | A game? |
| 是的  一个非常不妥的游戏  | Yes, a very disturbing one. |
| 你说的是什么游戏  | Well, what're we talking about? |
| 你发现他们在互抓屁股吗  | Did you catch those boys playing grab ass? |
| 不是  是《龙与地下城》  | No. Dungeons & Dragons. |
| 所以大家的裤子都有穿着是吗  | So everybody's got their trousers up? |
| -是的  -那有啥问题啊  | Yes. ?What's the problem? |
| 这游戏里有恶魔学  | The game contains demonology, |
| 那内容违反了教会的教导  | which goes against the teachings of the church. |
| 但没有人随便乱摸别人  对吧  | But nobody's touching nothing, right? |
| 没有  | No. |
| 那我不知道你有什么好担心的啊  | Well, then I don't quite know what you're worried about. |
| -你不知道吗  -不知道  | - You don't? - Nope. |
| 我只感恩比利交到了朋友  | I'm just thankful Billy found some friends |
| 而且不再吃泥土与马厩草了  | and he ain't eating dirt and crabgrass any more. |
| 也不知道什么时候  他突然就爱吃那些  | Some point, he just got a taste for it. |
| 说个不相关的  | On an unrelated note, uh, |
| 你最近有改变发型还是做头发吗  | you doing something new with your hair? |
| 看起来好美啊  | It looks, uh, real pretty. |
| 没有  但谢谢夸奖  | No, but thank you. |
| 好了  我不打扰你忙了  | Okay, well, I'm gonna leave you to it. |
| 也很好闻  | Smells good, too. |
| 好的  再见  | All right. Bye-bye. |
| 你们晚饭想吃鸡吗  | Hey, you want chicken for dinner? |
| 我现在就去帮你宰一只肥的  | I'll slaughter a big one for you right now. |
| 不用了  谢谢  | I'm good. |
| 我还是先杀一只  免得你改变主意吧  | I'll kill one in case you change your mind. |
| 你们谁已经活腻了  | Now which one of you's tired of this life? |
| 就你吧  | You. |
| 打扰了  阮先生  | Excuse me, Mr. Nguyen? |
| 你好  | Yes? |
| 您应该不认识我  我是谢尔顿的妈妈  | Hi, you don't know me. I'm Sheldon's mother. |
| 那个聪明孩子  | Ah, the smart boy. |
| 是的  那个聪明孩子  | Yes, the smart boy. |
| 你很幸运啊  | You are lucky. |
| 有个聪明的儿子是很幸福的事  | To have a smart son is a great joy. |
| 而我没有这种幸福  | I do not have that joy. |
| 肯定不是这样的  | Oh, I'm sure that's not true. |
| 我想请问一下  您知道丹跟谢尔顿  | Listen, are you aware that Tam and Sheldon |
| 在玩一个叫《龙与地下城》的游戏吗  | are playing Dungeons & Dragons? |
| 《龙与地下城》吗  | Dungeons & Dragons? |
| 是的  里面充斥着各种恶魔与撒旦的图像  | Yes, and it's filled with demons and satanic images. |
| 所以这游戏是有什么问题  | So what is the problem with this game? |
| 问题在于  | The problem is, |
| 这内容有违教会的教导  | it goes against the teachings of the church. |
| 好的  请听我说  | All right. Listen to me. |
| 在越共的再教育营里被饿死  那是个问题  | A problem is starving to death in a Communist reeducation camp. |
| 你多年不能见自己家人  | A problem is not seeing your family for many years |
| 还得去为胡志明小径扫除地雷时  那是个问题  | while you remove land mines from the Ho Chi Minh trail. |
| 一个里面有幻想恶魔的小男生游戏  | A game boys play with make-believe demons, |
| 不是个问题  | not a problem. |
| 我觉得这些都算得上是问题啊  | Well... I think they can all be problems. |
| 对不起  我同意你的说法  | I'm sorry, I agree with you. |
| 我会去跟丹谈谈  | I will talk to Tam. |
| 那太好了  谢谢您  | Oh, good. Thank you. |
| 那不打扰了  很高兴认识你  | Well, bye. Nice meeting you. |
| 五块钱  | Five dollars. |
| 牧师  | So, Pastor... |
| 最近教会还好吗  | How's things going at the church? |
| 不用客气  叫我杰夫就行  | Please, call me Jeff. |
| 教会一切都很好    | And everything's going great |
| 因为我有最赞的老板  | 'cause I have the coolest boss. |
| 不好意思  但我实在  | I'm sorry, but I'm kind of having a hard time |
| 无法理解圣灵叫你杰夫  | feeling the Holy Spirit calling you Jeff. |
| 我还是就叫你牧师吧  | I'm-I'm gonna stick with Pastor. |
| 没问题  | Sure. |
| 谢谢你了  牧师  | Thank you, Pastor. |
| 没错  这样感觉舒服多了  | Yeah, that feels better. |
| 太感谢你来一趟了  杰夫牧师  | So nice of you to come over, Pastor Jeff. |
| 他喜欢人家叫他杰夫  | He prefers Jeff. |
| 我就要叫他牧师  | I'm sticking with Pastor. |
| 等等  我改变主意了  我要叫你牧杰[PJ]  | Wait, I changed my mind. I'm going with PJ. |
| 缩写跟睡衣一样  不过也没事  | Brings to mind pajamas, but that's fine, too. |
| 言归正传  抱歉把您请过来处理  | Anyway, I'm sorry to drag you into this, |
| 但这事跟恶魔有关  所以是您的管辖范围  | but it is demons, so it's in your purview. |
| 的确是  | It is indeed. |
| 其实在最近的年轻浸信会领导会议  | In fact, at a recent Young Baptist Leaders Conference, |
| 我还去了撒旦娱乐活动研讨班  | I attended a seminar on satanic leisure activities. |
| 然后呢  | And? |
| 然后重点就是  | And the important lesson is, |
| 与其让父母或权威人物  | rather than have a parent or authority figure |
| 来把这犯戒的游戏拿走  | take the offending game away, |
| 让神来拿走它  连根拔起  | let God remove it, root and stem. |
| 提问  牧杰    | Question, PJ. |
| 上头的大佬怎么做到这事呢  | Uh, how's the big guy do that? |
| 很简单  谢尔顿得来主日学校  | Simple, Sheldon needs to start attending Sunday school. |
| 如果他喜欢有恶魔与魔鬼的书  | If he likes books with demons and devils, |
| 我这里有一本书能让他心醉神迷  | I've got one that will blow his mind. |
| 什么书  | What book is that? |
| 《圣经》啊  乔治  | The Bible, George. |
| 当然啦  | Sure, yeah. |
| 我觉得这个主意太棒了  | I think that's a wonderful idea. |
| 不过我有点担心  | Although, I am concerned |
| 谢尔顿可能会有些反抗  | that we may get a little pushback from Sheldon. |
| 有些吗  | A little? |
| 不要  我才不去  | No, I won't go. |
| 我不信神  | I don't believe in God. |
| 现在你信不信并不是重点  | Well, now, what you believe in is not the point. |
| 玛丽  请让我...  | Mary, if I may... |
| 谢尔顿  我知道你有一天想当科学家  | Sheldon, I understand you hope to be a scientist someday. |
| 是的  先生  | Yes, sir. |
| 那我问你一个问题  | Well, let me ask you a question. |
| 你说你不相信神  | You say you don't believe in God, |
| 但什么样的科学家会  | but what kind of scientist comes to a conclusion |
| 不做任何研究就下结论呢  | without first doing the research? |
| 烂科学家  | A bad scientist. |
| 没错  | That's right. |
| 那我们周日早上八点见吧  | So I'll see you Sunday morning at 8:00. |
| 不会见到我的  | No, you won't. |
| 我对自己施放二级法术隐身术  | I cast a second level spell of invisibility on myself. |
| 那游戏绝对没让他变聪明  | Well, that game isn't making him any smarter. |
| 谢利  你为什么还不睡觉  | Shelly, why aren't you asleep? |
| 我在为主日学校做预习  | I'm studying for Sunday school. |
| 你在读圣经吗  | You're reading the Bible? |
| 太好了  | That's wonderful. |
| 我有个问题  | I do have a question. |
| 没问题  你问吧  | Sure, what? |
| 我们镇上有人是亚玛力部落的吗  | Is there anyone in our town from the Amalek tribe? |
| 我不知道呢  怎么了  | I don't know, why? |
| 按书上说法  我们应该杀了他们与他们的牛  | If there is, we're supposed to kill them and their cows. |
| 没有  没有亚玛力人  | Well, no. There's no Amaleks. |
| 我就跟你说吧  | Told you. |
| 不叫我们遇见试探  | And lead us not into temptation, |
| 救我们脱离凶恶  | but deliver us from evil. |
| 因为国度  | For thine is the kingdom |
| 权柄  荣耀  | and the power and the glory |
| 全是你的  直到永远  阿门  | forever and ever. Amen. |
| -阿门  -非常好  | - Amen! - Very good. |
| 我们今天早上开始前  | Now before we get started this morning, |
| 我想跟大家介绍两位新学生  | I want to introduce two new students, |
| 谢尔顿与米希·库珀  | Sheldon and Missy Cooper. |
| 让我们来欢迎他们  | Let's give them a warm welcome. |
| 怎么了  比利  | Yes, Billy? |
| 我认识他们  | I know them. |
| 谢谢你  比利  | Thank you, Billy. |
| 不客气  杰夫牧师  | You're welcome, Pastor Jeff. |
| 上周呢  | Now, uh, last week, |
| 我们开始讲了约翰福音  | we started talking about the Gospel of John. |
| 有人有任何  | Does anybody have a notion |
| 对神在那里面要说的话的见解吗  | as to what God's getting at in that passage? |
| 来  谢尔顿  | Yes, Sheldon? |
| 约翰福音第一章第一节写到  | Chapter one, verse one states, |
| "太初有道    | "In the beginning was the Word, |
| 道与神同在  道就是神"  | and the Word was with God and the Word was God." |
| 非常好  | Well done. |
| 谢谢  我昨晚读了这福音  | Thank you. I read the gospels last night. |
| 马屁精  | Suck up. |
| 你知道当《圣经》里写到"道"的时候  | Did you know when the Bible says "The Word" |
| 是从最初的希腊语"逻各斯"而来的吗  | they're translating the Greek expression "logos" |
| 而"逻各斯"的意思就是知识  | and logos means knowledge. |
| 看来某人很有"逻各斯"呢  | Sounds like someone has a noggin full of "logos." |
| 比利  你说  | Yes, Billy? |
| 我们住同一条街  | They live on my block. |
| 太棒了  | Terrific. |
| 真不敢相信他在读《圣经》  | I can't believe he's reading the Bible. |
| 对啊  | I know. |
| 我其实还挺感谢《龙与地下城》这游戏  | I'm actually grateful to that Dungeons & Dragons game. |
| 它帮助我们带他走向神  | It helped lead him to God. |
| 言之过早  | Ixnay on the Odskay. |
| 完事了  | I'm done. |
| 你读完了吗  | You finished it? |
| 全读完了  考我什么鸟是犹太洁食  | All of it. Ask me which birds are kosher. |
| 这饵我咬了  什么鸟是犹太洁食  | I'll bite. Which birds are kosher? |
| 鸡  是  鹌鹑  也是  | Chickens, yes. Quail, yes. |
| 猫头鹰  没想到居然不是  | Owls, surprisingly no. |
| 反正它们身上也没多少肉  | Well, there ain't a lot of meat on them anyway. |
| 谢利  | Shelly, |
| 我很高兴你对宗教产生了兴趣  | I'm so happy you're taking an interest in religion. |
| 是啊  | I am. |
| 所以我决定要再去了解其他宗教  | And I've decided to explore other religions, too. |
| 你说什么  | What's this, now? |
| 杰夫牧师鼓励我  | Pastor Jeff encouraged me |
| 要用科学的方法接触宗教  | to approach religion scientifically, |
| 所以丰富我的资料库是很合理的  | so it only makes sense to enlarge my database. |
| 不  你的知识储备就是基督教浸信会  | No, your database is Baptist. |
| 你只需要这些资料就够了  | That's all the data you need. |
| 浸信会资料  | Baptist data. |
| 你还考虑了其他哪些宗教  | What other religions you considering? |
| 佛教  犹太教  | Buddhist, Jewish, |
| 印度教  天主教  全都考虑  | Hindu, Catholic, all of them. |
| 不  不行  | Nope. Nope. |
| 不许这样  | That's not happening. |
| 为什么  | Well, why? |
| 身为一个美国人  我难道没有信仰自由吗  | As an American, don't I have freedom of religion? |
| 现在龙啊  地下城啊  那些玩意儿  | Those dungeons and dragons are looking pretty good |
| 感觉没那么糟了吧  | right now, aren't they? |
| 我还想要研究巫毒教  | I'm also looking into voodoo. |
| 丹  你信仰天主教对吧  | Tam, you're Catholic, right? |
| 是啊  | Yes. |
| 跟我讲讲  | Explain it to me. |
| 讲什么  | Explain what? |
| 比如先说说  你向谁祷告  | Well, for starters, who do you pray to? |
| 大概是  耶稣  上帝与圣母玛利亚  | I guess, Jesus, God and Mary. |
| 耶稣不是上帝吗  | Jesus isn't God? |
| 不是  祂是祂儿子  | No, he's his son. |
| 但你吃祂肉  喝祂血  | But you do eat him, and drink his blood. |
| 还有个圣神[鬼]  | Oh, there's also a ghost, |
| 但不是恐怖的那种鬼  | but not the scary kind. |
| 像电影《鬼马小精灵》吗  | Like Casper? |
| 是的  | Exactly. |
| 那教宗是干嘛的  | And how does the pope work? |
| 教宗住在意大利梵蒂冈  | Well, the pope lives in Italy. |
| 他有特殊的教宗座驾  还有一顶大尖帽  | He has a special car, and a big pointy hat. |
| 是一定超赞的帽子  | It's a wonderful hat. |
| 还有什么我应该知道的东西吗  | And is there anything else I should know about? |
| 你时不时  | Every once in a while, |
| 就得去找一个神父告解罪恶  | you have to confess your sins to a priest. |
| 我不用  我没有任何罪恶  | Not me, I don't have any sins. |
| 那你有傲慢之罪  | Then you have the sin of pride. |
| 你的宗教让我自我感觉好差  | Your religion is making me feel bad. |
| 这样你才知道有效啊  | That's how you know it's working. |
| 哈钦斯女士  你信仰什么宗教呢  | Ms. Hutchins, what's your religion? |
| 我信仰摩门教  怎么了  | I'm a Mormon, why? |
| 我在做一个调查报告  | I'm conducting a research project. |
| 你能跟我说说摩门教吗  | Can you tell me about being a Mormon? |
| 这是在纽约创立的  | Well, it started in New York, |
| 有个人发现了一个被埋在地底的金页片  | when a man found gold plates buried underground. |
| 金页片上写了  | The plates said that, |
| 当我们去世之后  我们会飞升到自己的星球  | when we die, we get to go to our own planet. |
| 除非你是个女人  | Unless you're a woman, |
| 那你就会飞升到你丈夫的星球  | then you have to go to your husband's planet. |
| 但我不会有这个问题  | But that won't be a problem for me. |
| 因为我没有老公  | I don't have a husband. |
| 我只有我的喵星人  | All I have is a cat. |
| 一只又胖又凶的喵星人  | A big, mean cat. |
| 或许我有机会去它的星球  | Maybe I'll get to go to his planet. |
| 喵星球上的孤寡谢丽尔  | Lonely Cheryl on Planet Cat. |
| 我喜欢她  她好有意思  | I like her. She's funny. |
| 你会喜欢艾拉的  他人很好  | You're gonna love Ira. He's a great guy. |
| 他是你的男朋友吗  | Is he your boyfriend? |
| 是我其中一个  所以别提这方面的事  | Well, he's one of them, so let's not bring that up. |
| 现在方便吗  | Is this a good time? |
| 当然啦  请进  请进  | Absolutely. Come in, come in. |
| 艾拉  这是我外孙  谢尔顿  | Ira, this is my grandson Sheldon. |
| 谢尔顿  这是我朋友艾拉  | Sheldon, this is my friend Ira. |
| -你好啊  -你好  | - Hello. - Howdy. |
| 姥姥跟我说你是犹太人  | So Meemaw tells me you're Jewish. |
| 开门见山  | Right to it, huh? |
| 行  来吧  | All right, let's do this. |
| 请坐  | Please, sit down. |
| 谢谢你帮忙啊  | Thank you so much for helping out. |
| 康妮  你懂的  为你做什么都行  | Aw, Connie, you know, anything for you. |
| 谢尔顿  | So, Sheldon, |
| 你饿吗  | you hungry? |
| 想吃纳西[点心]吗  | You want a nosh? |
| 不知道啊  我没吃过纳西  | I don't know, I've never eaten a nosh. |
| 不是啦  纳西不是食物  | Uh, no, a nosh isn't a thing, |
| 是...  算啦  | it's a... never mind. |
| 你要来点硬糖吗  | Um, would you care for some hard candy? |
| 这是洁食吗  | Are they kosher? |
| 你怎么像我妈一样啊  | Who are you, my mother? |
| 好啦  我有何能为你效劳  | All right, so what can I do for you? |
| 当犹太人是种什么感觉  | What's it like to be Jewish? |
| 烂透了  我不建议  | Oh, it's terrible. I don't recommend it. |
| -为什么  -首先呢  | - Why? - Well, for starters, |
| 你会被许多古老没用的条条框框所限制  | your life is hemmed in by ancient, pointless rules. |
| 有很多吼来吼去的东西  | There's a lot of yelling, and, uh, |
| 然后基本上你也进不了什么好的乡村俱乐部  | you're probably not gonna get into a good country club. |
| 那上帝呢  | What about God? |
| 祂怎么了  | What about him? |
| 祂也是你生活中的一部分吗  | Does he play a part in your life? |
| 从历史上来说  祂教训我们教训挺爽的  | Well, historically, he's gotten a kick out of punishing us. |
| 那耶稣呢  | What about Jesus? |
| 他是犹太人啊  | He was Jewish. |
| 我们犹太人出很多名人啊  | Oh, we've got a lot of celebrities. |
| 我们有演员威廉·夏特纳  | Uh, we've got, uh, we got William Shatner, |
| 还有演员伦纳德·尼莫伊  | and Leonard Nimoy... |
| 寇克舰长与史波克吗  | Kirk and Spock? |
| 我想当犹太人了  | I want to be Jewish. |
| 你先慢着  | Hold on a second. |
| 等...  谢尔顿  我有个问题问你  | Hold-- I got a question for you, Sheldon. |
| 当你长大之后  你计划留在德州吗  | When you grow up, are you planning on living in Texas? |
| 大概吧  | Probably. |
| 那我强烈建议你继续信浸信会  | Then I strongly advise you to stay Baptist. |
| 能戴个十字架就更好了  | Maybe even wear a cross. |
| 那你为什么搬来德州  | Why did you move to Texas? |
| 很简单啊  | Well, that's simple. |
| 梅德福这里没有犹太人  刚好开放了一个名额  | Medford had no Jews, so there was an opening for one. |
| 而你得到了名额吗  太厉害啦  | And you got it? Good for you. |
| 我好喜欢这孩子  | I love this kid. |
| 我也是  | Me, too. |
| -怎么样了  -很好啊  | - How's it going? - Good. |
| 你知道波斯拜火教之祖信仰两个神吗  | Did you know that Zoroaster believed in two gods? |
| 我不知道呢  | No, I did not. |
| 而道教的人完全不相信有神  | And the Taoists don't believe in God at all. |
| 而是相信天人合一  与自然和谐共处  | They believe in a principle of harmony. |
| 那他们很棒棒啊  | How very nice for them. |
| 谢利  我知道你很喜欢研究东西  | Shelly, I understand you enjoy researching things. |
| 爱死了  | Love it. |
| 但有一件很重要的事要记住  | But it's important to keep in mind |
| 世界上只有一个真神  | that there is only one true God. |
| 你这个叫一神论  | That's called monotheism. |
| 如果你有兴趣深入了解  我这里有一本书  | I have a book about it if you're interested. |
| 没事  我有最重要的"那本书"了  | That's okay, I have the book about it. |
| 如果我没选你的宗教  你会生我气吗  | Would you be angry with me if I don't pick your religion? |
| 我永远不会生你的气  | I could never be angry with you. |
| 你尽情去探索自己真理  | You be a seeker of your own truth. |
| 谢谢妈妈  | Thanks, Mom. |
| 但如果你探索到的真理是撒旦  | And if the truth turns out to be Satan, |
| 那我会与它对战到底  | I will do battle with him. |
| 谢尔顿  欢迎你  | Welcome, Sheldon. |
| 我们已经等候你多时  | We've been waiting for you. |
| 你们是十诫吗  | Are you the Ten Commandments? |
| 不是  | No. |
| 我们是1  | We are one. |
| 与0  | And zero. |
| 我们是二进制码  | We are the binary code |
| 宇宙的基础  | that underlies the universe. |
| 什么十诫只是常见的错误  | The ten thing is a common mistake. |
| 我想了解神  | I want to understand God. |
| 你们能帮我吗  | Can you help me? |
| 你没听懂我们刚才说的吗  | Did you not hear what we just said? |
| 这是个二元宇宙  | It's a binary universe. |
| 神就是是与否  | God is yes and no. |
| 左与右  | Left and right. |
| 开与关  | On and off. |
| 有与无  | Something and nothing. |
| 正与负  | Positive and negative. |
| 男与女  | Male and female. |
| 光与暗  | Light and dark. |
| 那为什么世上会有邪恶与磨难呢  | But why is there evil and suffering? |
| 没有邪恶与磨难  | Well, without evil and suffering, |
| 又怎么会有正义与幸福呢  | there is no good and happiness. |
| 对哦  二元嘛  | Oh, sure. Binary. |
| 我们应该告诉他有关  | Shall we give him the final piece of information |
