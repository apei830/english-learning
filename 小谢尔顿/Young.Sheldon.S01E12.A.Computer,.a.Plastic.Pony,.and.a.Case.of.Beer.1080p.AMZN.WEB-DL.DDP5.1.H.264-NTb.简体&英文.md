| 英特尔8086处理器  | With an Intel 8086 |
| 运行速度8兆赫兹  | running at eight megahertz |
| 加上一个5.25吋软盘驱动器  | and a five-and-a-quarter-inch floppy drive, |
| 我简直无所不能  | there was nothing I couldn't do. |
| 从给我的作业增加碉堡的图形  | From adding snazzy graphics to my homework... |
| 碉堡了  | So snazzy. |
| 到轻松地按字母顺序排列  | ...to easily alphabetizing |
| 我敌人的名字及其罪行  | my list of enemies and their crimes. |

| 我们要一台电脑干什么  | What on earth do we need a computer for? |
| 对啊  我们有你和你的大脑袋  | Yeah, we got you and your big head. |
| 但有了电脑  我们可以完成很多事情  | But we can get so much accomplished. |
| 我可以用电子制表程序  | I could use a spreadsheet program |
| 记录你的日常开支  | to keep track of your expenses. |
| 我用我的支票本背面记了  | I do that in the back of my checkbook. |
| 但你打开你的支票本时  它会哔地一声响吗  | Yes, but does your checkbook go "Beep" when you open it? |

| 用的是索引卡片  | On index cards. |
| 就像远古山顶洞人  | Like a cave person. |

| 这些都不重要  谢尔顿  | It doesn't matter, Sheldon. |
| 我们买不起电脑  | We can't afford a computer. |
| 买得起  现在只要998美刀  | Sure we can. It's only $998, |
| 戴夫说我们可以每个月分期付款购买  | and Dave says we can buy it on easy monthly payments. |
| 没错  | That's true. |
| 别多事  戴夫  | Stay out of this, Dave. |
| 走吧  | Come on. |
| 我们得回家了  | We got to get home. |
| 可是...  | But... |
| 谢尔顿  不行就是不行  | Sheldon, I said no. |
| 展品电脑我可以给你个优惠价  库珀夫人  | I can make you a good deal on the floor model, mrs. Cooper. |
| 说真的  戴夫  你要惹毛我了  | Seriously, Dave, you're getting on my nerves. |
| 这不公平  | It's not fair. |

| 那才十美分  | For ten cents. |
| -每一分钱都没白花  -走吧  | - And I'm worth every penny. - Let's go. |

| 就是它  坦迪1000SL电脑系统  | Here it is, the Tandy 1000 SL computer system. |
| 今天谢尔顿不停地在念叨这玩意  | Sheldon was going on and on about that thing today. |
| 我从来没见过这么易于使用的电脑  | I've never seen one so easy to use. |
| 你们好  需要指引你们回母星的路吗  | Greetings. Need directions back to your planet? |
| 这科技比我们想象中更先进  | This technology is more advanced than we thought. |
| 你们知道《E.T. 外星人》这部电影吗  | You know that movie E.T.? |
| 发现外星人的小孩叫艾略特  | The kid who finds him, his name is Elliott, |
| 名字首字母是E  尾字母是T  | which starts with an "E" And ends with a "T." |
| 巧合吗  | Coincidence? |
| 我可不这么认为  | I don't think so. |
| 你这辈子都要跟我们住在一起了  是吗  | You're gonna live with us forever, aren't you? |
| 谢尔顿想要台电脑啊  | So, Sheldon wants a computer? |
| 自打他会说话就吵着要  | Ever since he could talk. |
| 看到这个更变本加厉了  | But now more than ever. |
| 他可以放了学后干点零工  | Well, he should get a job after school. |
| 自己攒钱买一台  | Save up and buy one. |
| 干零工  他才九岁  | Get a job? He's nine. |
| 像他这么大的时候  我都去帮人修剪草坪了  | I mowed lawns when I was his age. |
| 还挣了不少钱呢  | Made pretty good money. |
| 你想让谢尔顿去修剪草坪吗  | You want Sheldon to mow lawns? |
| 他这么弱不禁风  在太阳底下五分钟  | He's so pale, five minutes in the sun, |
| 就会被烧成灰  | he'd burst into flames. |
| 我愿意付钱看这一幕  | I would pay to see that. |
| 闭嘴  小乔治  | Shut up, Georgie. |
| 希望你跟他说过我们买不起  | I hope you told him we can't afford it. |
| 当然说了  | Of course. |
| 我可以先给他买一台  | I could buy it for him, |
| 然后你们可以等有钱了再还给我  | and then y'all could pay me back when you can. |
| 好吧  康妮  你这话就等于在羞辱我  | Okay, Connie, now you're just insulting me. |
| 那并不是我的本意  | Well, that was not my intention, |
| 但我很乐意你这么想  | but I'm glad to hear it. |
| 我有能力支付自家的开支  | I can pay my own bills |
| 也有能力照顾好我的家人  | and take care of my family. |
| 我们的确可以削减某些开支  | There are expenses we could cut back on |
| 这样我们就能买得起电脑了  | so we could afford a computer. |
| 你是说你给教堂的那些钱吗  | You mean like the money you give to church? |

| 孤星啤酒公司的钱  | to the Lone Star Beer company. |
| 说得好  妈妈  | Good one, Mom. |
| -闭嘴  -闭嘴  小南瓜  | - Shut up. - Shut up, pumpkin. |
| 我们不买电脑  | We're not getting a computer. |
| 我们也不需要你的钱  | We don't need your money. |
| 你去哪里  | Where are you going? |
| 去倒...  一杯牛奶  | To get a... glass of milk. |
| 他撒谎  他要去倒啤酒  | He's lying. He's getting a beer. |
| 闭嘴  小乔治  | Shut up, Georgie. |
| 妈妈  | Mom? |
| 你怎么还不睡  | Why are you still up? |
| 居里夫人在房顶  | Madame Curie is on the roof, |
| 而且她没有戴帽子  | and she's not wearing her hat. |
| 你在做梦呢  宝贝  | You're just dreaming, baby. |
| 可她没帽子会着凉的  | But she'll be cold without her hat. |
| 我把我的给她  你快睡吧  | I'll give her mine. Now you go to sleep. |
| 谢谢  妈妈  | Mm, thanks, Mom. |
| 你最好了  | You're the best. |
| 老天啊  | Oh, Lord. |
| 我猜我们的每周一"日"要取消了  | I'm guessing we're not having our once-a-week. |
| 抱歉  我只跟我喜欢的绅士发生关系  | Sorry, I only have relations with gentlemen I like. |
| 拜托  你明知道我不喜欢  | Oh, come on. You know how I feel |
| 你妈干涉我们家的财务  | about your mother meddlin' in our finances. |
| 她不是来干预  她只是想帮忙  | She wasn't meddlin', she was offering to help. |
| 而且电脑不是什么白痴玩具  | And that computer is not some silly toy. |
| 谢尔顿可以用来做作业  | Sheldon could use it for his schoolwork, |
| 而我可以用来...整理我的菜谱  | and I could use it to... organize my recipes. |
| 你早就用那些小卡片整理好了  | You already got 'em organized on those little cards. |
| 是啊  像个山顶洞人  | Yeah, like a cave person. |
| 这都不重要  | Well, it doesn't matter. |
| 重点是我们买不起  话题结束  | We can't afford it, end of story. |
| 或许还没完全结束  | Not exactly end of story. |
| 这话什么意思  | What's that mean? |
| 过去几年我一直在存钱  | I've been setting money aside the last couple of years, |
| 或许养兵千日就是用在此时了  | and this might be a good use for it. |
| 你哪里来的钱啊  | Money from what? |
| 就是这里存点  那里存点来的啊  | You know, here and there. |
| 帮教堂记账  | Bookkeeping for the church, |
| 接一些针线活  | some seamstress work, |
| 塞尔达阿姨给的生日红包  | birthday money from my Aunt Zelda. |
| 你"这里那里"攒下来的钱  | And just how much of this "Here and there" money |
| 有多少啊  | you got saved up? |
| 鉴于这是我的钱  | Well, seeing as it's my money, |
| 有多少你管不着  | I don't think that's any of your business. |
| 我管不着吗  | None of my business? |
| 我挣的每一分你都要管  你却有私房钱  | You see every nickel I make, and you got secret money? |
| 这不是私密  我刚告诉你了  | It's not secret. I just told you. |
| 你把钱藏哪儿了  | Where you hiding it? |
| 现在你可问到了私密问题  | Well, now you're headed into secret territory. |
| 好吧  | Oh, okay. |
| 我确定一下  我的钱是我们的钱  | Just so I'm clear, my money's our money, |
| 但你的钱是你自己的钱  | but your money's your money. |
| 没错  | That's right. |
| 很高兴知道这一点  | Oh, good to know. |
| 还好我们每周一"日"活动取消  | I'm glad we're not having our once-a-week |
| 因为老子现在完全没心情  | 'cause I am not in the mood. |
| 真的吗  | Really? |
| 那真是太可惜了  | That's too bad. |
| 为什么  你有吗  | Why? Are you? |
| 有你个大头鬼  | No! |
| 需要这么耍我吗  | That was uncalled for. |
| 忘记告诉你了  有个女孩打来找你  | I forgot to tell you, a girl called for you. |
| 什么女孩  | What girl? |
| 我不知道  就一个女孩  | I don't know. A girl. |
| 她说什么了  | Well, what'd she say? |
| 想不太起来  都好几个月前了  | It's hard to remember. This was months ago. |
| 两箱啤酒  | Two cases? |
| 你在和我开玩笑吧  | You've got to be kidding me. |
| 别担心  我没有用你的钱  | Don't worry, I didn't use your money. |
| 我用了我的钱  | I used mine. |
| 快吃完你们的晚饭  | Finish your dinner |
| 吃完收拾行李  | and then pack a bag. |
| 我们要去姥姥家  | We are going to Meemaw's. |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 因为你们爸妈需要分开一段时间  | Because your mom and dad need a break from each other. |
| 分开多久  | For how long? |
| 我不知道  赶紧收拾  | I don't know. Just pack. |
| 我需要带耳罩吗  | Will I need earmuffs? |
| 想带就带上吧  | Sure, if you want. |
| 不过我的年鉴预测温度适宜  | Although my almanac does predict mild temperatures. |
| 那就别带了  | Then don't bring it. |
| 我就带上我的年鉴吧  | I'll just bring my almanac. |
| 算了  我两样都带上吧  | You know what, I'll bring both. |
| 我该带上我的牙刷吗  | Should I pack my toothbrush |
| 还是直接用放在姥姥家那支  | or use the one I keep at Meemaw's? |
| 这题我来回答  | I got this one. |
| 谁管你啊  | Nobody cares. |
| 我不想去姥姥家  | I don't want to go to Meemaw's house. |
| 万一那女孩又打来怎么办  | What if that girl calls back? |
| 行  那你就跟你爸待在这里  | Fine, then stay here with your father. |
| 谢尔顿  米希  我们半小时后就走  | Sheldon and Missy, we are out of here in half an hour. |
| 没多少时间让我考虑带不带牙刷啊  | Not a lot of time to pick a toothbrush. |
| 进来吧  | Come on in. |
| 妈妈跟爸爸需要分开一段时间  | Mom and Dad need a break. |
| 我们不知道要多久  | We don't know how long. |
| 他都带了什么  | What's he got in there? |
| 什么都带了  | Everything. |
| 我永远都不要结婚  | I ain't never getting married. |
| -是吗  -对啊  | - That so? - Yeah. |
| 女人都是麻烦精  | Women are nothing but trouble. |
| 我去接  | I'll get it! |
| 你好  我是小乔治  | Hello, Georgie speaking. |
| 你跑来接电话了吗  感觉自己像白痴吗  | Did you run to the phone? Do you feel stupid? |
| 谁啊  | Who was it? |
| 没谁  | Nobody. |
| 我跟你妈之间的小矛盾很快就会过去  | This little tiff between your mom and me will blow over. |
| 别小题大做  | Don't make a big deal of it. |
| 我没有啊  我只是说  | I'm not. I'm just saying |
| 我更适合当一匹单身独狼  | I'm better suited to the single life. |
| 何以见得  | And how do you picture that? |
| 你知道外面那些自助餐餐厅吧  | Okay, well, you know the buffet at Golden Corral, |
| 有各式各样的食物随你挑选  | where there's all kinds of choices |
| 而且你想吃多少份多少种都随你  | and you can have as much as you want? |
| 知道啊  | Yeah. |
| 单身就跟那个一样  不过是随便选辣妹  | It'll be like that, only with hot girls. |
| 小乔治  我跟你打赌1000块  | Georgie, I'll bet you a thousand dollars |
| 你会在25岁之前就结婚  | you're married before you're 25. |
| 跟你赌了  | You got a bet. |
| 感觉就像直接偷你的钱啊  | I feel like i'm stealing your money. |
| 小乔治在19岁时娶了他第一任老婆  | Georgie married his first wife at 19. |
| 他一直没把赌输的钱给我爸  | He never paid my father. |
| 我想告诉你们我很开心  | Well, I got to tell you how happy I am |
| 有你们来我家过夜  | that y'all are spending the night with me. |
| 你家闻起来一股烟味  | Your house smells like cigarettes. |
| 太开心了  | So happy. |
| 谢尔顿  我们谈过这个事情了  | Sheldon, we've talked about this. |
| 你别去跟人家说哪里有什么味道  | You don't need to announce to people how things smell. |
| 好啦  你们两个都躺好  | All right, you two, settle in. |
| 你跟爸爸会离婚吗  | Are you and Dad gonna get a divorce? |
| 当然不会啦  | Of course not. |
| 你确定吗  打包行李带着你的孩子  | Are you sure? Packing up your kids |
| 大半夜搬去你妈妈家  | in the middle of the night and moving in with your mom |
| 这都是离婚的信号  | has all the earmarks of a divorce. |
| 我们不会离婚  | We're not getting a divorce. |
| 乖乖睡觉吧  | Okay, go to sleep. |
| 祝好梦  | Sweet dreams. |
| 真不敢相信爸妈为了啤酒吵架  | I can't believe Mom and Dad had a fight over beer. |
| 我觉得不是因为啤酒  | I don't think the fight was about beer. |
| 应该还有潜在理由  | I think there was more subtext. |
| 我估计你说的是对的  | You're probably right. |
| 虽然我不懂"潜在理由"是什么  | Then again, I don't know what subtext is. |
| 我不想多事掺和你们的家事  | I don't want to get in your business, |
| 但既然你都"掺和"到我床上了  | but since you're getting in my bed, |
| -我只好掺和了  -问吧  | - I'm getting in your business. - Go ahead. |
| 你什么时候走  | When you leaving? |
| 真好笑  | Very funny. |
| 这不是玩笑话  | That wasn't a joke. |
| 我爱你  也爱孩子们  | I love you, and I love the kids, |
| 但我更爱你们住在街对面  | but I love you better living across the street. |
| 抱歉我婚姻的终结给你带来不便  | Sorry the end of my marriage is inconveniencing you. |
| 别小题大做好吗  | Oh, don't be so dramatic. |
| 只是吵个小架而已  | It's a little spat. |
| 不  这是积累已久的矛盾  | No, this was a long time coming. |
| 这问题关系到我们婚姻的内核  | This goes to the very core of our relationship. |
| 看来你是要继续小题大做了  | I see we're sticking with dramatic. |
| 他一发现我自己有存私房钱  | The minute he found out I had money set aside, |
| 就觉得受到威胁  你知道为什么吗  | he felt threatened. And you know why? |
| 因为这代表我不依靠他也能独立生活  | 'Cause it meant that I can live independent of him. |
| 比如睡在你妈咪的床上吗  | Sleeping in your mommy's bed? |
| 你懂我意思  | You know what I mean. |
| 你准备给谢尔顿买那台电脑吗  | You gonna buy Sheldon that computer? |
| 现在不买也不行了  | Well, now I have to. |
| 知道了  | Got it. |
| 你知道我还有活跃的性生活吧  | You do know I still have an active love life. |
| 赶快睡吧  | Just go to sleep. |
| 就在这张床上"活跃"  | On this very bed. |
| 我的妈啊  | Oh, Mom. |
| 早餐吃什么  | What's for breakfast? |
| 我也不知道  倒一碗麦片吧  | I don't know. Grab a bowl of cereal. |
| 妈妈通常给我们做鸡蛋和吐司  | Mom usually makes us eggs and toast |
| 偶尔还会有肉  | and the occasional meat. |
| 妈妈又不在家  | Well, Mom isn't here, is she? |
| 某人今天下床错边  起床气很大啊  | Whoa. Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed. |
| 明明整张床任你选边  | And you had a choice 'cause you had the whole bed. |
| 小乔治  | Georgie. |
| 你在拿生命开玩笑  | Walking on thin ice. |
| 也许你该到街对面道歉  | Maybe you should go across the street and apologize. |
| 我不能那样做  | I can't do that. |
| 为什么  | Why not? |
| 因为如果我去了  就立下了不好的先例[总统]  | 'Cause if I do, it sets a bad precedent. |
| 尼克松总统跟这事有什么关系  | What's Nixon got to do with it? |
| 什么  | What? |
| 你说"不好的总统"  尼克松就是总统啊  | You said "Bad president," like Nixon. |
| 就是这个家伙啊  | You know, this guy. |
| 你要去道歉吗  | You going to apologize? |
| 爸爸  | Dad! |
| 爸爸  | Dad! |
| 如果是的话  带肉回来  | If you are, bring back meat! |
| 希望你这下开心了  | Hey. I hope you're happy. |
| 谢谢你  小乔治  你真好  | Thank you, Georgie. That's very kind. |
| 爸妈吵架就因为你想要一台破电脑  | Mom and Dad are fighting because you want to get a stupid computer. |
| 你在说什么  | What are you talking about? |
| 妈妈想买给你  | Mom wanted to buy it for you, |
| 爸爸说买不起  | Dad said they couldn't afford it, |
| 姥姥说她给买  | Meemaw offered to pay for it, |
| 结果现在我只能吃菠萝条当午餐了  | and now I'm eating pineapple spears for lunch. |
| 我讨厌自己做午餐  | I hate making my own lunch. |
| 对不起  小乔治  我不知道  | I'm sorry, Georgie, I didn't know. |
| 现在你知道了  | Yeah, well, now you do. |
| 你午餐是什么  | What did you get? |
| 妈妈切成心形的火鸡三明治  | A turkey sandwich Mom cut in the shape of a heart, |
| 水果杯  布朗尼蛋糕  | a fruit cup, a brownie, |
| 还有一张姥姥写的字条  说她有多爱我  | and a note from Meemaw saying how much she loves me. |
| 我还没看  但我猜一定是超爱  | I haven't read it yet, but I bet it's a lot. |
| 我连开罐器都没有  | I don't even have a can opener. |
| 小马  我好爱你呀  | Oh, Sugar Apple, I love you so much. |
| 你对无生命物品的情感吓到我了  | Your affection for inanimate objects frightens me. |
| 你开心就好  米希  | I'm glad you're happy, Missy. |
| 我更高兴的是我得到了玩具  而谢尔顿屁都没有  | I'm even happier that I got a toy, and Sheldon got nothin'. |
| 我们还没购完物呢  | Well, now, we're not exactly done shopping. |
| 谢尔顿  你还想要那台电脑吗  | Sheldon, you still want that computer? |
| 我们不是买不起吗  | I thought we couldn't afford it. |
| 这你就不用担心了  | Don't you worry about that. |
| 你到底想不想要  | Do you want it or not? |
| 想得不得了  | More than anything. |
| 好吧  那我们就去买  | All right, then, let's go get it. |
| 等等  他能得到电脑  而我只有破玩具吗  | Wait. He gets a computer and I get a lousy toy? |
| 你不是喜欢吗  | I thought you liked it. |
| 现在不喜欢了  | Not anymore. |
| 水从哪里流出来啊  | Where's the water come out of? |
| 那是烘衣机  不会有水流出来  | Well, seeing as that's the dryer, nowhere. |
| 所以这个才是洗衣机  | So this one's the washer? |
| 不骗你  | No foolin' you. |
| 你在干什么  | What are you doing? |
| 把白色和其他颜色的分开  | Separating the whites from the colors. |
| 这是种族歧视啊  | Whoa, that's racist. |
| 我怎么会有一个儿子是火箭科学家  | How did I get a rocket scientist for one son |
| 另一个却是园游会白痴小丑  | and a rodeo clown for the other? |
| 我超希望能成为园游会小丑  | Oh, man. I'd give anything to be a rodeo clown. |
| 他们给人带来欢乐  | They make people happy, |
| 还能免费看牛仔竞技  | and they see the rodeo for free. |
| 我终于得到了  | The home computer I had long coveted |
| 梦寐以求的家用电脑  | was finally in my possession, |
| 但它同时也在摧毁我的家庭  | but it was also destroying my home. |
| 幸好  电脑自带了一个程序  | Thankfully, it came pre-loaded |
| 能帮助解决私人问题  | with a program to help solve personal problems. |
| 你好  我是伊莱莎  | Hello, I am Eliza. |
| 我  父母  | My... parents... |
| 正在  吵架  | are... fighting... |
| 经常吵  | a lot. |
| 我知道了  你能详细说说吗  | I see. Can you elaborate on that? |
| 我妈妈  | My mother... |
| 给我买了  | bought... me... |
| 这台  | this... |
| 电脑  | computer... |
| 但  | but... |
| 我爸  说  我们  | my dad... says... we can't... |
| 买不起  | afford it. |
| 你对你妈妈有意见吗  | Do you have issues with your mother? |
| 没有  | Mmm... No. |
| 她  给我做  | She... makes me... |
| 意粉  | spaghetti... |
| 里面还有  | with hot dogs... |
| 热狗丁  | cut up in it. |
| 你能详细说说吗  | Can you elaborate on that? |
| 你到底  | Are you... |
| 会不会帮我  | going to help me or not? |
| 你好  我是伊莱莎  | Hello, I am Eliza. |
| 未来或许被高估了  | The future might be overrated. |
| 好了  水肯定接通了  | Okay, water's definitely on. |
| 现在试试  | Try it now. |
| 我们要轻柔洗还是常规洗  | We want delicate or regular? |
| 无所谓  赶紧按开始吧  | It doesn't matter, just turn it on. |
| 选轻柔洗吧  比较保险  | Let's go with delicate to be safe. |
| 没反应  | Nothin'. |
| 该死  | Damn it. |
| 等等  我知道该怎么做  | Wait, I know what to do. |
| 怎么做  | What? |
| 到街对面  向妈妈道歉  | Go across the street and apologize to Mom. |
| 我没什么好道歉的  | I got nothin' to apologize for. |
| 你不用真心道歉  我从来就不是  | You don't have to mean it. I never do. |
| 小乔治  别多管闲事  | Georgie, just mind your business. |
| 好吧  抱歉  | Okay, sorry. |
| 为防你想知道  | In case you were wondering, |
| 我刚才不是真心的  | I didn't mean that. |
| 看到这有多简单了吗  | See how easy it is? |
| 这些家用电脑太了不起了  | These home computers are amazing. |
| 有了它  我都能开展真正的记账生意了  | I could start a real bookkeeping business with that thing. |
| 那对你得到你想要的经济独立  | And that would go a long way to giving you |
| 可大有帮助啊  | the financial independence you're looking for. |
| 可不是嘛  | Darn tootin'. |
| 告诉你一声  | Just for your information, |
| 谢尔顿现在正在用电脑  | Sheldon is using the computer right now |
| 试图修复你的婚姻  | to try and fix your marriage. |
| 真的吗  | Really? |
| 电脑怎么说  | What did it say? |
| 它说  | It said... |
| "滚出你妈的房子"  | "Get out of your mother's house." |
| -妈妈  -我是认真的  | - Mom. - I'm serious. |
| 我想抽烟  我受够了躲在车库后面偷偷抽  | I want a cigarette, and I'm tired of hiding behind the garage. |
| 你觉得我该向乔治道歉吗  | You think I should apologize to George? |
| 当然不是  那会立下一个不好的先例  | Well, of course not. That would set a terrible precedent. |
| 我觉得你应该回家  | I think you should go back over there |
| 收拾点衣物给孩子们  | to pick up some clothes for the kids |
| 一边装出冷漠疏远的样子  | and be all cold and distant, |
| 那他就得向你道歉了  | so he has to apologize to you. |
| 这主意不坏  | Oh, that's not bad. |
| 照做吧  | Do it. |
| 我会的  | I will. |
| 你怎么还在喝茶  | Why you drinking tea? |
| 滚 蛋  | Get out. |
| 你好  | Oh, hello. |
| 你这是要回来吗  还是...  | Were you coming back, or... ? |
| 只是给孩子们拿点换洗衣物  | Just to get some clothes for the kids. |
| 你是来找我谈谈的吗  | Were you coming to talk to me? |
| 这个嘛  是的  | Well... yeah. |
| 我  | I, um... |
| 想道歉  | ...wanted to apologize. |
| 真的吗  | Really? |
| 想散散步吗  | Want to go for a walk? |
| 聊一聊  | Talk a little? |
| 好啊  | Sure. |
