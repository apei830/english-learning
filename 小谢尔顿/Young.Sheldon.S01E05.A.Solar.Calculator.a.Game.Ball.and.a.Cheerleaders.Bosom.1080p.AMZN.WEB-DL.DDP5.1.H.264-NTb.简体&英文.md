| 在德克萨斯  神圣的三位一体是上帝  | In Texas, the Holy Trinity is God, |
| 橄榄球与烧烤  | football and barbeque, |
| 顺序可以互换  | not necessarily in that order. |
| 谁输谁赢无所谓  让分后算我赢就行  | I don't care if you win, just cover the damn spread. |
| 妈  你又开始赌球了吗  | Mom, are you betting again? |
| 没有  | No. |
| 球迷们如坐针毡  | ...fans on their feet, |
| 希望队伍展开防守  | trying to urge the defense on. |
| 橄榄球中  攻方有4次进攻机会  | 弃踢是常见战术 |
| 第四攻了  | Fourth down. |
| 必须得弃踢  | Gotta punt. |
| 必须  | Gotta. |
| 数据上来说  总在第四攻弃踢  | Statistically, always punting on fourth down |
| 弃踢是将球踢远  虽然球权也转移给对手  | 但对方就必须从较远的地方开始进攻 |
| 是十分不合理的  | makes no sense. |
| 数据上来说  你就是个傻逼  | Statistically, you're a dumbass. |
| 当德州农工大学队  | When the Aggies give up the ball |
| 被对方在自家五码线进攻时  | on their own five-yard line, |
| 对方队伍有92%的几率会得分  | the opposing team has a 92% chance of scoring. |
| 当他们从自家场地深处弃踢出去  | When they punt from deep in their own territory, |
| 对方队伍还是有77%的几率得分  | the other team still has a 77% chance of scoring. |
| 但他们继续进攻有50%几率再得4次进攻机会  | But since they convert on fourth down 50% of the time, |
| 所以计算显示他们不该弃踢  | the math says they should never punt again. |
| 好了  你偷偷跟妈说    | Okay, you can tell me, |
| 他亲生父亲到底是谁  | who's his real daddy? |
| 谢尔顿  我踢球与当教练一辈子了  | Sheldon, I've been playing and coaching football all my life. |
| 我觉得你算得不对  | I don't think your math is right. |
| 是吗  | Really? |
| 你等等  | Hang on. |
| 不  没算错  | No, it's right. |
| 让农工队只是射门得分的话  | ...able to hold A&M to a field goal, |
| 他们就只会落后6分  | they'll only be down six points. |
| 是你的牙医吗  | Is it your dentist? |
| 那个戴眼镜的小个子  | The little guy with the glasses? |

| 之后哪天可能就会来个意大利小伙  | next thing you know, there's an Italian fella |
| 来把她的小货车开走抵债  | driving off with her pickup truck. |
| 你觉得谢尔顿说得对吗  | You think Sheldon's right? |
| 哪件事情  | About what? |
| 弃踢还有他的计算  | The punting and the math. |
| 我相信应该对  | I should think so. |
| 从他六岁时起  我们家纳税就是他在弄  | He's been doing our taxes since he's six years old. |
| 我们也没被税局稽查  | We never been audited. |
| 这倒是  | That's true. |
| 他去年还帮我们拿到退税呢  | He even got us that nice refund last year. |
| 为什么今天不是妈载我去学校  | How come Mom's not taking me to school? |
| 因为有时候  | 'Cause once in a while, |
| 你老爸也会想跟你相处一下啊  | your dad wants to spend some time with you. |
| 我的小谢仔  | My little Shel-man. |
| 但是妈的车有后座  | But Mom's car has a backseat. |
| 数据上来说  我坐那里比较安全  | Statistically, I'm much safer there. |
| 我刚好也想跟你聊一下这个数据  | Hey, I'm glad you brought up statistically. |
| 你觉得你昨天说的德州农工大学队的数据  | You think those numbers you talked about for Texas A&M |
| 也能用在我带的队伍上吗  | would apply to my JV squad? |
| 没道理不能啊  | I don't see why not. |
| 数学与前任校长不同的是  数学不歧视人  | Unlike our former principal, math doesn't discriminate. |
| 你不会是想用他的建议吧  | You're not thinking about taking his advice, are you? |
| -用不着你管  -可是他是错的  | - Never you mind. - But he's wrong. |
| 大家都知道第四攻应该弃踢  | Everybody knows you punt on fourth down. |
| 为什么大家都知道就等于它是对的  | Why does everybody knowing something make it right? |
| 因为  | Because. |
| 美国就是因此而伟大  | That's what makes this country great. |
| 许多年后  | Many years later, |
| 我哥也用了这段话  | my brother would use this same argument |
| 跟法官解释  | in front of a judge. |
| 但他在电话亭里撒尿的事还是被定罪了  | He was still convicted for urinating in a phone booth. |
| 靠  | Oh, damn it. |
| 我去让弃踢手上场  | I'll send in the punting team. |
| 等等  你等等  | Hang on. Hang on. |
| 怎么  | What? |
| 继续进攻  | Let's go for it. |
| 为什么  我们时间还很充足啊  | Why? We got plenty of time. |
| 我知道  还是想要继续进攻  | I know. Still want to go for it. |
| 我们在12码线上呢  大家都知道该保守弃踢  | We're on the 12-yard line. Everybody know you punt. |
| 为什么大家都知道就等于它是对的  | Why does everybody knowing something make it right? |
| 但是在我们球门口啊  教练  | But we're on the 12-yard line, Coach. |
| 教练让我们继续进攻  | Okay, Coach says we're going for it. |
| 白痴弟弟  | Stupid brother. |
| -什么  -没事  | - What? - Nothing. |
| 左侧突破  准备  散开  | Power left jumbo on two, on two. Ready, break! |
| 狼队在第四攻选择继续进攻  | And your Wolves are going for it on fourth down. |
| 什么鬼  弃踢啊  | What the hell? Punt! |
| 数据上来说  继续进攻比较好  | Statistically, they're better off going for it. |
| -谁说的  -我儿子  | - Says who? - My little boy. |
| 这就是为什么大家都弃踢  | That's why everybody punts. |
| 这简直就是脑袋抽风  | That was just plain foolishness. |
| 你小儿子可真天才啊  | Your little boy's a real genius. |
| 他还真是天才  | Well, actually he is. |
| 不是吧  | Come on. |
| 犯规  防守方场上人数过多  | Too many men on the field, defense. |
| 第四攻重来  | Replay fourth down. |
| 感谢老天  | Ah. Thank you, Jesus. |
| 我现在可以叫弃踢手上场了吗  | Now, can I send in the punt team? |
| 教练  | Coach? |
| 他们再度继续进攻  | And they're going for it again. |
| 什么鬼啊  弃踢啊  | What the hell? Punt! |

| 晚安姥姥  | Night, Meemaw. |
| 我能请你帮个忙吗  | Can I ask you a favor? |
| -可以啊  什么事  -你还记得  | - Sure. What? - You know those statistics |
| 你跟你爸爸说的那些什么数据吗  | that you were talking about with your dad? |
| 那些数据也能套用到...  | Could... could that be applied to, say, |
| 比如说下周的牛仔与包装工队比赛吗  | who might win the Cowboys-Packers game next week? |
| 能不能更详细到差多少分之类的  | And, more specifically, by how much? |
| 如果我有足够数据  应该可以给出合理猜测  | I suppose with enough data I could make a reasonable guess. |
| 我不要猜测  我要确切的  | I don't want a guess, I want to know. |
| 妈说不可以赌博  | Mom said you're not supposed to gamble. |
| 睡你的觉  死小孩  | Sleep, child! |
| -妈  -在这里呢  | - Mom? - In here! |
| 我明天把那些数据弄给你  | I'll get those numbers to you tomorrow. |
| 来哄他睡觉  | Just tucking him in. |
| 我有东西给你  | I got something for you. |
| 是脏的  | It's dirty. |
| 因为这是比赛用过的球  | Well, that's 'cause it's the game ball. |
| 这是你应得的  因为你帮我们赢了比赛  | And you earned it, 'cause you helped us win. |
| 好吧  但你能先洗一洗吗  | Okay, but can you wash it? |
| 谢尔顿  你爸爸是在夸你  以你为荣呢  | Sheldon, your daddy's telling you he's proud of you. |
| 好吧  谢谢你  爸爸  | I see. Thank you, Dad. |
| 不客气  | You're welcome. |
| 但我还是不要碰它  | I'm still never touching that. |
| 去帮他擦干净吧  | Let's go wipe it off. |
| 接下来的五周  | For the next five weeks, |
| 我继续帮我爸爸套用数据  | I continued to help my father apply statistics |
| 来执教他的队伍  | to coach his team. |
| 毫无意外地  队伍一直在赢  | Not surprisingly, they continued to win, |
| 这让我在学校的地位冲上云霄  | which changed my status in the school dramatically. |
| -他来啦  -谢尔顿  | - There he is! - Yo, Sheldon! |
| 谢狗  | Shel-dog! |
| 数学哥  | Math man! |
| 小可爱  | Hey, cutie. |
| 简直就是一场恶梦  | It was a nightmare. |
| 谢狗  | Shel-dog! |
| 拥抱  弄乱头发  击掌  | Hugging, hair tousling, high fives. |
| 我的人气冲上云霄  我在空中的时间也长了  | And as my popularity grew, so did my time aloft. |
| 我到处在找你呢  | Hey, I've been looking all over for you. |
| 你知道我们现在人气有多高吗  | Do you know how popular we are? |
| -我们吗  -对啊  | - We? - Yeah. |
| 我放出消息  说我有帮忙你算橄榄球的数据  | I put the word out I was helping you with the football stats. |
| 他们看我是亚洲人就信了  | And since I'm Asian, they bought it. |
| 你享受这感觉我替你高兴  | Well, I'm glad you're enjoying it. |
| 你不享受吗  | You're not? |
| 今天一下午  我被人摸了82次  | I was touched 82 times this afternoon. |
| 你说"摸"是什么意思  | What do you mean, "touched"? |
| 不是不合适地乱"摸"  | Not inappropriately. |
| 是开心地  | Joyfully. |
| 充满热情地  | Affectionately. |
| 还有一个拉拉队员抱我入她胸  | A cheerleader hugged me to her bosom. |
| 太爽了吧  | That's amazing. |
| 我不要再击掌了  | No more high fives. |
| 我不想一直洗手  | I can't keep washing my hands. |

| 我不需要计算器啊  爸  我就是计算器  | I don't need a calculator, Dad. I am one. |
| 行吧  | Sure. |

| 是太阳能的  | It's solar-powered. |

| 小乔治  小声点  | Georgie, turn that down! |

| 看看你房间  快给我整理干净  | And look at this room. You need to clean this mess up. |
| 我等会再弄  | I'll get to it later. |
| 不行  你现在就整理  | No, you'll get to it now. |
| 我不想  | I don't feel like it. |
| 不管你想不想都现在去打扫  | Well, your feelings have nothing to do with it. |
| 也不要再丢那个球了  | And stop throwing that ball. |
| 我房间让你这么看了烦  那你来打扫  | My room bothers you so much, you clean it. |
| 够了  你被禁足了  听到没  | That's it! You are grounded! You hear me?! |
| 怎么回事  | The hell? |

| 很晚了  他已经睡了  | It's late. He's in bed. |
| 我想问他要不要跟我一起去派对  | Oh. I was hoping he might like to go to a party with me. |
| 大家都集体发疯了吗  | Has everyone lost their mind? |
| 他还是个孩子  丹  | He's a little boy, Tam! |
| 晚安  | Good night! |
| 天啊  今晚你那张嘴好像机关枪似地  | Good Lord, that mouth of yours is a machine gun tonight. |
| 你在干什么  | What are you doing? |
| 试着算出下周日海豚队  | Trying to calculate the odds of the Dolphins |
| 让分后赢的几率  | covering the spread next Sunday. |
| 我喜欢海豚  | I like dolphins. |
| 他们用脑袋上的洞来说话  | They talk out of that hole in their head. |
| 你好  | Hello. |

| 就在马路对面  | It's right across the street. |
| 带我进去  然后你就可以回来睡觉了  | Just get me in, and you can go back to bed. |
| 我得先问下我妈妈  | I have to ask my mom. |
| 不用了  她知道派对的事  | No need. She knows all about the party. |
| 那好吧  | All right, then. |
| 给我一分钟换身衣服  | I need a minute to change. |
| -你为什么穿这个  -能让我看起来成熟些  | - Why are you wearing that? - It makes me look older. |
| 先把话说清楚  一把你弄进去  | Just so we're clear, once you get in, |
| 我就回家了  | I'm going home. |
| 好呀  谢尔顿  | Hey! Sheldon! |

| 各位快看啊  谢尔顿来了  | Hey, everybody, check it out! Sheldon's here! |
| 希望孩子们不会被那派对吵醒  | I hope that doesn't wake up the kids. |
| 要不要我去那边说说他们  | Should I go over there and say something? |
| 我觉得有这必要  | I think you should. |
| 我刚只是吹牛  | I was bluffin'. |
| 别逼我把袜子穿回去  | Don't make me put my socks back on. |
| 算了  | Never mind. |
| 晚安  | Good night. |
| 晚安  | Good night. |
| 我朝小乔治大吼了  我觉得很内疚  | I feel bad about yelling at Georgie. |
| 他该骂  | He deserved it. |
| 你应该多吼他几次  | You should do it more. |
| 我想他是觉得被冷落了  | I think he's feeling left out |
| 因为你和谢尔顿现在常黏在一起  | now that you and Sheldon are spending so much time together. |
| 你在逗我吗  | Are you kiddin' me? |
| 是你一直叫我找到和谢尔顿的共同话题  | You're always saying to find something in common with Sheldon. |
| 现在我找到了  你又说我冷落小乔治了  | And now that I have, you're telling me I'm ignoring Georgie? |
| 我没那么说  | I'm not saying that. |
| 我只是提醒你  | I'm just reminding you |
| 你有两个儿子  | that you got two sons. |
| 我知道  | I know. |
| 我还有个女儿  也应该多跟她相处  | I also got a daughter I need to spend more time with. |
| 确实是的  | You do. |
| 但我不担心她  | But I wouldn't worry about her. |
| 她就是个小天使  | She's an angel. |
| 谢尔顿  谢尔顿  谢尔顿  | Sheldon! Sheldon! Sheldon! |
| -放我下来  -谢尔顿  谢尔顿  | - Put me down! - Sheldon! Sheldon! |
| 快把我放下来  | I said put me down. |

| 米希  你在这儿干吗  | Missy, what are you doing here?! |
| 放纵享乐  你又在这儿干吗  | Cuttin' loose. What are you doing here? |
| 慢点  慢点  | Slowly! Slowly! |
| 慢点  | Slowly! |
| 你也来了  | You, too?! |
| 你好  小乔治  | Hello, Georgie! |
| 你不应该来这里  | You're not supposed to be here. |
| 你也不该来  你被禁足了  | Neither are you! You're grounded! |
| 走吧  | Come on. |
| 你们俩现在就给我回家  | Both of you are going home. Now. |
| -谢天谢地  -不要嘛  | - Oh, thank goodness. - Aw. |
| 青春期对你影响如何  | How's puberty treating you? |
| 它可让我长大了许多  | Because it is knocking me for a loop. |
| 对吧  | Right? |
| 我父母居然没发现我去纵情派对了  | Somehow, my parents didn't find out about me partying heartily. |
| 但蜡烛两头烧  | But I did pay a price |
| 确实让我付出了代价  | for burning the candle at both ends. |
| 我数学考试时犯了错  | I made a mistake on a math test. |
| 我太累了  我在脑子里运算  | In my exhaustion, I did all the calculations in my head, |
| 结果像动物园里的动物一样  忘了写出计算过程  | and, like a common zoo animal, forgot to show my work. |
| 我刚遇到派对上的一个女生  | I just saw one of those girls from the party, |
| 她对我做了这个动作  像承认了我的存在  | and she acknowledged my existence by doing this. |
| 人生首次感到如此有存在感  | I've never felt so alive. |
| 你还好吗  | Are you okay? |
| 不好  | No, I'm not. |
| 这又怎么样  | Yeah, so? |
| B+  这是走向终点的开始  | A B-plus-- that's the beginning of the end. |
| 什么终点  | The end of what? |
| 我的人生  | My life. |
| 如果我不做出改变  谁知道我会堕落到什么地步  | If I don't make some changes, who knows how far I'll fall. |
| 说不定我会变成瘾君子  或律师  | I could wind up a drug addict, or a lawyer. |
| 你会不会反应过激了  | Is it possible you're overreacting? |
| 不  从今天起  我不再帮橄榄球队了  | No. Starting today, I'm done helping the football team. |
| 你这样妹子们再也不会这么跟我打招呼了  | But if you do that, girls will no longer greet me like this. |
| 我会这么跟你打招呼  | I'll greet you like that. |
| 这不一样  | It's not the same. |
| 让我自己从这些事中抽身  | Extricating myself from this situation |
| 并非易事  | was not going to be easy. |
| 我父亲指望着我  我姥姥指望着我  | My father was counting on me, Meemaw was counting on me, |
| 学校也指望着我  | the school was counting on me. |
| 深思熟虑后  我决定  | After much thought, I decided to employ |
| 采取最靠得住的战略策略  | the one strategic maneuver I knew I could count on. |
| 打小报告  | I tattled. |
| 妈妈  | Mom? |
| 谢尔顿得了B+  真是太糟糕了  | Sheldon got a B-plus! That's terrible for him! |
| 我对你们三个非常失望  | I'm very disappointed in all three of you. |
| 没错  米希  这是给你上芭蕾课穿的  | That is right. Missy, this is for your ballet class. |
| 你们不许去派对玩  | We do not go to parties. |
| 我非常失望  | I am very disappointed. |
| 我要去给队伍弄些装备  你想一起去吗  | Got to go pick up some equipment for the team; you want to join me? |
| 去不了  我被禁足了  | Can't. I'm grounded. |
| 是啊  不过  | Yeah, well... |
| 你不说  我也不会说出去  | I won't tell if you won't. |
| 谢尔顿去吗  | Sheldon going? |
| 那个背信弃义的小崽子  当然不去  | That little snitch? Absolutely not. |
| 谢尔顿还会帮你算数吗  | Sheldon still gonna help you with the math? |
| 我想不会了  | I don't think so. |
| 但我听说过他那个亚洲人朋友也会算  | But I did hear his little Asian friend can do it. |
| 你好  | Hello. |
| 话说  | So... |
| 这个周日油工队赔率是让四分  | Oilers are a four-point favorite for this Sunday's game, |
| 但是是油工队主场  所以我想赌主队让分赢盘  | but it's a home game, so I'm thinking I give the points. |
| 你觉得呢  | What do you think? |
| 我觉得我又得告发你了  | I think I have to tell on you again. |
| 有本事就去啊  你妈能怎样  禁我的足吗  | Go ahead. What's your mama gonna do, ground me? |
| 买油工队  让分赢盘  | Take the Oilers, give the points. |
| 我爱你  小饼饼  | I love you, Moonpie. |
| 告诉你们  油工队输了那场比赛  | For the record, the Oilers lost that game |
| 对手四次触地得分  | by four touchdowns. |
| 姥姥再也没问过我意见了  | Meemaw never asked for my advice again. |
| 来啊  来啊  我靠  | Come on, come on, come on. Damn it! |
| 好了  | Okay. |
| 再一次  | One more time. |
| 妈妈需要台新的摩托艇  | Mama needs a new Jet Ski! |

| 不是的  | 'Fraid not. |
| 反正你该去看看他的表演  | Oh, well, you ought to check him out. |
| 他会让你大吃一惊的[脱掉袜子]  | He'll, uh, knock your socks off. |
| 我喜欢穿着袜子  | I like my socks on. |
| 康妮  你让我很为难  | Connie, you're putting me in a very awkward position. |
| 我玩基诺彩票赢了一台面包烤箱  | I won a toaster oven playing keno. |
| 你想要吗  | You want it? |
| 我自己有  | I got one. |
| 我想要我的钱  | I want my money. |
| 好啊  | All right. |
| 稍等  | Hang on. |
| 你的外套很好看  | That's a very nice jacket. |
| 你穿着看上去很帅  | You're looking dapper. |
| 这个赌场送我免费住宿  | Hey, they comp my room here. |
| 你也有这个待遇吗  | They do that for you? |
| 事实上  他们不太欢迎我来  | Actually, they frown upon my presence here. |
| 我还拿到了自助早餐的优惠券  | Oh. I also get a coupon for the breakfast buffet. |
| 你应该去问问  | You should look into that. |
| 康斯坦丝  | Constance! |
| 耐心点  文森索  | Patience, Vincenzo. |
| 赞啦  | Yes! |
| 太好了  这才像话嘛  | All right, now we're talking. |
| 你愿意收硬币作为头期款吗  | Will you take a down payment in quarters? |
| 我有选择吗  | Do I have a choice? |
| 开捞吧  | Start scoopin'. |
| 我得去看托尼·奥兰多了  | I got to go see Tony Orlando. |
| 再给我一个杯子  | Hey, I need another cup! |
