| 首先  谢谢两位抽空过来  | First off, I want to thank you both for coming. |
| 行了行了  他又做什么了  | Yeah, yeah, what'd he do? |
| 他没有做什么啊  | Uh, he didn't do anything. |
| 天啊  汤姆  我也想信你这话  | Gosh, Tom, I want to believe you. |
| 好吧  问题就是  对谢尔顿来说  | Okay, the problem is, the curriculum here |
| 我们的课程不够有挑战性  | is not challenging enough for Sheldon. |
| 现在他觉得没意思了  | Now, he gets bored |
| 而且或许他没有用最有效的方式  | and maybe doesn't express himself |
| 来表达自己的意见  | in the most productive way. |
| 所以sin2 + cos = 1  | And so the square of sine plus cosine equals one. |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon. |
| 我不想让您难堪  | I don't want to embarrass you, |
| 所以我给您点时间  | so I'm going to give you a moment |
| 自己想想您刚才说的话  | to think about what you just said. |
| 马克艾罗伊女士  | Ms. MacElroy. |
| 怎么了  | What? |
| 我很好奇您有没有读过您给我们的指定读物  | I'm wondering if you read the book you assigned to us, |
| 因为我读了  | because I did. |
| 跑20圈  | 20 laps. |
| 库珀  | Cooper. |
| 如果您要叫我们跑步  | If you're going to ask us to run, |
| 您是不是该自己带头以身作则  | don't you think you should lead by example? |
| 你的意思是他对老师没礼貌吗  | So you're saying he's being rude to his teachers? |
| 这可不行  我们会找他谈谈  | That's unacceptable. I'll-I'll give him a talkin' to. |
| 我不知道是不是该说他没礼貌  | I don't know if I'd call him rude. |
| 那该怎么说  | Well, put a word on it. |
| 没礼貌  就称为没礼貌吧  | Rude, let's go with rude. |
| 没礼貌这词就行  | Rude is good. |
| 那你想我们怎么做  | So what do you want us to do? |
| 我想让你们考虑下给他换种教育方式  | I want you to consider another approach to his education. |
| -好吧  -这是什么意思  | - Okay. - What does that mean? |
| 我最近刚好跟  | I recently had a nice chat with the head |
| 威尔莫特天才学院的校长谈过  | of Wilmot Academy for Gifted Children. |
| 我跟她说了谢尔顿的事  她好像觉得  | Now, I told her all about Sheldon, and she seemed to think |
| 谢尔顿非常适合到他们学校就读  | he would be a perfect fit over there. |
| 我们已经看过私立学校了  | We already looked into private school. |
| 我们承担不起学费  | We can't afford it. |
| -除非你给我加薪  -没这打算  | - Not unless you're giving me a raise. - I'm not. |
| 好吧  我就问问  | Okay, just checking. |
| 不过我可以告诉你们  | But I can tell you this. |
| 众所周知威尔莫特  | Wilmot has been known |
| 会为像谢尔顿这样的孩子提供全额奖学金  | to give children like Sheldon full scholarship. |
| 你们看看  | Take a look at that. |
| -我的天啊  -真的假的  | - My goodness. - No kidding. |
| 你们好好看看  | Yeah, just read up on it. |
| 认真考虑一下吧  | Give it some thought. |
| 等等  | Hold on. |
| 这学校在达拉斯  离这里三小时车程呢  | This place is in Dallas; that's three hours away. |
| 是啦  不过...  | Well, yeah, but, uh, |
| 像你们这样的案例  | what they do in cases like yours, |
| 他们会帮忙找一户当地家庭给他提供寄宿    | they look for a local family for him to live with. |
| 乔治  达拉斯呢  | And, George, Dallas? |
| 达拉斯的距离够近  | Dallas is certainly close enough |
| 他每周末都可以回家过啊  | that he can come home on the weekends. |
| 我们很感谢你们为他如此费心    | Look, we appreciate you going to bat for him, |
| 但他就是个小孩子  | but he's just a wee little thing. |
| 我们怎么能把他送去达拉斯  | We can't ship him off to Dallas. |
| 我们不应该先谈过再决定吗  | Shouldn't we talk about this first? |
| 有什么好谈的啊  乔治  | What's there to talk about, George? |
| 这或许是对谢尔顿很好的机会呢  | This could be a great opportunity for Sheldon. |
| 他才9岁  | He's nine years old. |
| 那又如何  他又不能用地球年算岁数  | Oh, come on, you can't measure him in Earth years. |
| 你在说他是外星人吗  | You're saying he's an alien? |
| 我帮乔治说句话  | Well, in George's defense, |
| 大家也不是没这么想过...  | that idea has been tossed around... |
| 就一两次啦  | a little bit. |
| 烂笑话  | That's a bad joke. |
| 我能理解这是很大的决定  | Look, I understand this is a big decision. |
| 如果你们改变主意了  就打给我  | If you change your mind, give me a call. |
| 我很乐意为你们去安排个面试  | I'd be more than happy to set up an interview. |
| -谢了  -不客气  | - Uh, yeah. Thank you. - You bet. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 或许你们才是外星人  | Maybe you all are the aliens. |
| 我爱我的工作  | I love my job. |

| 我不知道你们怎么舍得拒绝不去  | Well, I don't understand how you could turn this down. |
| 那学校看起来很赞啊  | This place looks fantastic. |
| 在320公里外呢  妈  | It's 200 miles away, Mom. |
| 我知道达拉斯在哪里  | I know where Dallas is. |
| 我以前都去那里买大麻  | I used to buy my marijuana there. |
| 真的吗  | Really? |
| 我说了"以前"  | I said "used to" |
| 然后我怀上了这货  | Then I got pregnant with this one |
| 然后乐子就离我一去不复返  | and all the fun stopped. |
| 我的意思只是  | All I am saying is that |
| 这或许对谢尔顿是很好的机会  | this would be a great opportunity for Sheldon. |
| 我知道你说得有道理  | I know, you're right. |
| 她说得对吗  | Whoa, she's right? |
| 我今天在办公室里也说了同样的话  | I said the same thing in Petersen's office, |
| 你就像看傻子一样看我  | you looked at me like I was an idiot. |
| 就是这表情  | Yeah, that's the look. |
| 或许你们在这事上都有些自私了  | Maybe y'all are being a little selfish about this. |
| 自私吗  我们是为他着想  | Selfish? We're thinking of him. |
| 这样是很不错啊  | Well, that's all well and good, |
| 但或许你们该为全世界也想想  | but maybe you should be thinking about the whole world. |
| 我的意思是  | I mean, |
| 要是爱因斯坦的父母也阻止他的发展呢  | what if Einstein's parents had held him back? |
| 那我们就不会有...  | We wouldn't even have the... |
| 本来要说原子弹  | Well, I was gonna say atomic bomb, |
| 但应该有别的更好的例子  | but there's probably a better example. |
| 我有个疯狂的建议  | Here's a crazy idea: |
| 要不我们问问谢尔顿自己的看法呢  | how about we ask Sheldon what he thinks of all this? |
| 问吧  但他不会想去的  | Go ahead, but he's not gonna want to go. |
| 这里是他的家  我们是他的家人  | This is his home, we're his family. |
| 谢尔顿  你能过来一下吗  | Sheldon, can you come in here for a minute?! |
| 怎么了  | Yes? |
| -过来坐  我们想跟你说件事  -好吧  | - Have a seat. We want to talk to you. - All right. |
| 今天我们知道在达拉斯有家学校  | So, today we found out about a school in Dallas |
| 是为特别聪明的孩子开设的  | for really smart kids. |
| 我什么时候能去就读  | When can I start? |
| 等等  达拉斯很远  | Hold on. Dallas is far away, |
| 你去了就得住在别人家  | so you'd have to live with another family. |
| 他们有养狗吗  | Do they have a dog? |
| 我们不知道  | Uh, we don't know. |
| 那你能打电话问问吗  | Well, can you make some calls? |
| 可以吧  但是你不会想爸爸妈妈吗  | I guess, but wouldn't you miss your mom and dad? |
| 或许会吧  | Yes, I suppose I will. |
| 所以你什么时候能打去问狗的事  | So, when are you calling about the dog? |
| 你真是了解他呀  | You know him so well. |
| 他们是什么毛病  | What's wrong with them? |
| 你是什么意思  | What are you talking about? |
| 他们好安静  | They're so quiet. |
| 他们是吃了药吗  | Are they on medication? |
| 不是  他们只是跟你一样聪明  | No, they're just smart like you. |
| 原来我以前是在动物园里上学啊  | I've been going to school in a zoo. |
| 这制服我有点说不准啊  | Not sure about these uniforms. |
| 感觉有点娘  | Kinda froufrou. |
| 谢尔顿  我看了你的成绩单  | Sheldon, I've been looking over your transcripts |
| 不得不说  非常出色啊  | and I must say, I am very impressed. |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 您的博士学位是哪方面的  | What's your doctorate in? |
| 非交换代数拓扑  | Noncommutative Algebraic Topology. |
| 我喜欢她  | I like her. |
| 谢尔顿不在这里会感觉很奇怪吧  | It's gonna be weird around here without Sheldon. |
| 应该是变不奇怪才对吧  | Don't you mean less weird? |
| 这么说太不友好了  | That's not nice. |
| 我没有想要友好啊  | I wasn't trying for nice. |
| 你确定你不是在嫉妒  | You sure you're not jealous |
| 你弟弟更上层楼了吗  | 'cause your little brother's moving up in the world? |
| 我对自己的人生也有计划  | Hey, I got plans of my own. |
| -愿闻其详  -等到我高中毕业  | - Do tell. - Soon as I graduate high school, |
| 我就要去当一个职业男模  | I'm gonna be a professional male model. |
| 真是笑死人了  | That is hilarious. |
| 怎么  我长得很帅啊  | What? I'm good-lookin'. |
| 不是  是你觉得你高中能毕业  | No, that you think you'll graduate high school. |
| 模特的部分也很好笑  | The model thing was funny, too. |
| 不得不说  | I must tell you, |
| 我在这里任职多年  但从没见过  | in all the years I've been here, I have never seen |
| 老师们集体写出如此高评价的推荐函  | such glowing letters of recommendation from a student's teachers. |
| -那真是太好了  -你们听听  | - Well, that's real nice to hear. - Now, listen to this: |
| "除了他超凡的智商  | "Putting aside his superior intellect, |
| 谢尔顿还是课堂上的一个宝  | Sheldon is a delight to have in the class. |
| 他风趣爱笑  | He's fun-loving, |
| 平易近人  | Easy to get along with, |
| 还总是乐于助人"  | and always ready to help another student." |
| 这听起来完全不像我啊  | That doesn't sound like me at all. |
| 当然像啦  宝贝  | Sure it does, sweetie. |
| 道格拉斯博士  | Dr. Douglas... |
| 别  叫我弗罗拉就可以了  | Oh, no. Please call me Flora. |
| 弗罗拉  我必须得跟您请教关于住的事情  | Flora, I have to ask about the living arrangements. |
| 那是我们最关心的事  | That's our main concern. |
| 这件事你们可以放一百个心  | Well, I think I can reassure you about that. |
| 我跟我丈夫一直给一名学生  | My husband and I have been hosting a student |
| 提供寄宿了许多年  他最近刚毕业  | for the last several years who recently graduated |
| 现在去名校普林斯顿大学了  | and is now at Princeton. |
| 所以我们家现在有多一间空的客房  | So we have a guest room available in our home. |
| 您真是太慷慨了  | That's very generous of you. |
| 您丈夫也在学校里教书吗  | Does your husband work at the school also? |
| 没有  他退休了  | No, he's retired. |
| 他以前是太空总署的天体物理学家  | He was an astrophysicist for NASA. |
| 请告诉我你们家没养狗  | Please tell me you don't have a dog. |
| 没养  我们夫妇对狗过敏  | No. We're both allergic. |
| 我心痒难耐  | I'm tingling. |
| 姥姥  | Meemaw? |
| 姥姥  | Meemaw. |
| 我知道  我特别好看  | I know. I look great. |
| 我有离别礼物要送你  | I got you a little going away gift. |
| 进来  | Come on in. |
| 这项链在我们家族传了许多代了  | This necklace has been in our family for generations. |
| 曾是一个科曼奇族勇士的所有物  | It belonged to a Comanche warrior |
| 他把它送给了你曾曾曾曾祖母  | who gave it to your great-great-great-great grandma. |
| 他为什么要给她  | Why'd he give it to her? |
| 根据我们的家族传说  | Well, according to family lore, |
| 她是个非常"好客"的姑娘  | she was, uh, a very accommodating young lady |
| 他们一拍即合  | and, uh, they hit it off. |
| 这是鸟羽  | That's a bird feather. |
| -是鹰羽  -都无所谓  | - Eagle feather. - Doesn't matter. |
| 我不喜欢鸟  鸟都很脏  | I don't like birds; birds are filthy. |
| 别说了  | Okay. |
| 行吧  | Fine. |
| 一个无羽的传家宝  | One featherless family heirloom |
| 让你带着上路  保你平平安安  | for you to take with you and keep you safe while you're away. |
| 你不会真相信这东西有魔力吧  | You don't actually believe this has magic powers, do you? |
| 我的神啊  你就说"谢谢"就行了  | Oh, for God's sake, just say "thank you." |
| 谢谢  | Thank you. |
| 上面有标价  | There's a price tag on it. |
| 并没有  | No, there's not. |
| 我来啦  | Hello! |
| 有人在家吗  | Anybody home? |
| 你来啦  | Hi. |
| 玛丽  | Mary. |
| 他每周五晚上都会回来  | He's gonna come home every Friday night. |
| 我一直以为得等到他上大学  | I didn't think I'd have to deal with this |
| 我才会需要面对这种事  | till he went to college. |
| 你就谢谢上天保佑  | You should thank your lucky stars |
| 他不是现在在上大学吧  | he's not in college now. |
| 我还是不确定这个决定对不对  | I'm still not sure that this is the right thing to do. |
| 你是担心他不喜欢那里  | Are you worried that he won't like it |
| 还是担心他会喜欢上呢  | or are you worried that he will? |
| 你这是帮倒忙  | You're not helping. |
| 安慰你不是我的职责  | That's not my job. |
| 我自认为是实话发表员  | I think of myself as a speaker of truth. |
| 如果你不打算安慰我  就走吧  | If you're not gonna make me feel better, go away. |
| 真不好意思  你甩不掉我了  | I'm sorry. You are stuck with me. |
| 如你们所见  | As you can see, |
| 即使在我小的时候  | even as a small child, |
| 大家就喜爱我的陪伴  | people cherished having me around |
| 会为我的离开而哭泣  | and wept over my absence. |
| 对我即将离开  没人比我最好的朋友丹  | And no one took my impending departure harder |
| 更难过了  | than my best friend, Tam. |
| 你明天就走了吗  | So you leave tomorrow? |
| 是的  | Yes. |
| 达拉斯  | Dallas. |
| 没错  | Yes. |
| 真棒  | Cool. |
| 我很感动  | It was touching |
| 看着丹勇敢地忍住眼泪  | to watch Tam bravely fight back tears. |
| 你有没有考虑过让火车朝顺时针方向走  | Have you ever thought about making the trains go clockwise? |
| 没有  | No. |
| 你应该考虑一下  | You should. |
| 勇敢  非常勇敢的丹  | Brave, brave Tam. |
| 你醒着吗  | You awake? |
| 是的  | Yes. |
| 你会想我吗  | Are you gonna miss me? |
| 我还没想过这件事  | I haven't given it any thought. |
| 我们躺着也没事干  | Well, we're just lying here. |
| 现在想想吧  | Think about it. |
| 我习惯了有你在  | I am used to you. |
| 我也习惯了有你在  | I'm used to you, too. |
| 这跟喜欢你不是一回事  | It's not the same as liking you. |
| 确实不是  | No. |
| 对我来说  你就像豆角  | To me, you're like string beans. |
| 没人主动想要  | No one asks for them, |
| 没人质疑它们的存在  | no one wonders about them. |
| 它们就出现在盘子上  | They're just there on the plate. |
| 但你会吃掉  对吧  | But you eat them, right? |
| 是的  | Yes. |
| 你会想我的  | You're gonna miss me. |
| 好了  我们来做饭前祷告  | All right, let's say grace. |
| 看来现在轮到我跟你握手了  | Guess I get to hold hands with you now. |
| 是的  | Guess so. |
| 也许谢尔顿戴手套也不是个坏主意  | Maybe Sheldon's mittens weren't such a bad idea. |
| 感谢上帝  赐予我们食物  | Thank you, God, for this food we are about |
| 给予我们身体营养  | to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies. |
| 请保佑为我们准备食物的人  | And bless the hands that prepared it. |
| 还有  上帝  请你照看我们的谢尔顿  | And, God, we ask that you watch over our Sheldon... |
| 因为他开启了一段精彩的新...  | as he begins this wonderful new... |
| 因为他开启了  | ...as he begins |
| 人生一段精彩的新篇章  | this wonderful new chapter in his life. |
| -阿门  -阿门  | - Amen. - Amen. |
| 你为什么哭了  | Why you cryin'? |
| 你为什么那么蠢  | Why you stupid? |
| 今天在达拉斯情况怎么样  | So how'd it go in Dallas today? |
| 挺顺利的  | Went fine. |
| 他们都很友善  | Nice people. |
| 感觉谢尔顿对一切都感到挺自在的  | Sheldon seemed very comfortable with the whole thing. |
| 欢迎  一路上顺利吗  | Welcome! How was the drive? |
| 进城时有点堵车  但除此以外都很顺畅  | Eh, a little traffic comin' into the city but otherwise okay. |
| 谢尔顿  来见见我丈夫  艾略特  | Sheldon, I want you to meet my husband, Elliot. |
| 艾略特  这是谢尔顿  | Elliot, this is Sheldon. |
| 认识你很高兴  小伙子  | Well, it's nice to meet you, young man. |
| 我听说了很多关于你的事  | I've heard a lot about you. |
| 乔治  他们根本不是这个样子  | George, that is not at all how they were. |
| 你在说什么呢  | What are you talking about? |
| 他们绝对有些不对劲  | There was definitely something off about those people. |
| 真的吗  | Really? |
| 我错过什么了  | What'd I miss? |
| 欢迎  | Welcome! |
| 一路上顺利吗  | How was the drive? |
| 进城时有点堵车  但除此以外都很顺畅  | Eh, a little traffic comin' into the city but otherwise okay. |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon, |
| 谢尔顿  来见见我丈夫  艾略特  | I want you to meet my husband, Elliot. |
| 艾略特  这是谢尔顿  | Elliot, this is Sheldon. |
| 认识你很高兴  小伙子  | Nice to meet you, young man. |
| 我听说了很多关于你的事  | I've heard a lot about you. |
| 拜托  | Oh, come on. |
| 你说得他们好像是怪物一样  | You're making it out like they were some kind of monsters. |
| 谢尔顿有自己的房间  | Sheldon has his own room. |
| 到处都摆满了书  | There's books everywhere. |
| 还有个很大的后院  虽然他不会去玩  | Even has a big old backyard he won't play in. |
| 你是不是忘了什么  | Aren't you forgetting somethin'? |
| 什么  | What? |
| 地下实验室  | The underground laboratory. |
| 我想那叫装修过的地下室  亲爱的  | I think it's called a finished basement, honey. |
| 我知道自己看到了什么  | I know what I saw. |
| 玛丽  今天很累了  | Mary, it's been a long day. |
| 我们能不能就安静吃饭  | Can we just have a quiet dinner? |
| 好啊  | Sure. |
| "他们都很友善"  | "Nice people." |
| 那我们为什么还把他留在那里  | Then why did we leave him there? |
| 因为我们爱他  希望给他最好的  | Because we love him and we want the best for him. |
| 气氛好紧张  | This is tense. |
| 我和孩子们今天过得很愉快  | Me and the kids had a nice day. |
| 看了很多橄榄球赛  | Watched a lot of football. |
| 话说  迈阿密海豚队的头盔上真有只海豚  | You know, the Dolphins' helmet has a dolphin on it. |
| 那只海豚也戴了一顶头盔  | And that dolphin is also wearing a helmet. |
| 但这顶头盔上就没有海豚图案了  | But his helmet doesn't have a dolphin on it-- |
| 而是印着"M"  | it has the letter "M." |
| 我们聊这个话题聊了一小时  | We talked about that for an hour. |
| 好了  | All right. |
| 开动吧  | Dig in. |
| 不好意思  | Excuse me. |
| 我们不做饭前祷告吗  | Aren't we going to say grace? |
| 我们家不做这个  | Uh, we don't do that in our house. |
| 但你想做可以做  | But you're welcome to do so. |
| 没关系  我不信有上帝  | That's all right. I don't believe in God. |
| 那你为什么要做饭前祷告  | Well, then why would you say grace? |
| 因为那会让我妈妈高兴  | Because it makes my mom happy. |
| 那你为什么戴着手套  | And why are you wearing mittens? |
| 因为我不知道你们的手都摸过什么  | Well, I don't know where your hands have been. |
| 好吧  | Okay. |
| 不如我们开始吃吧  | Maybe we should just eat. |
| 你喜欢豆角吗  | Do you like string beans? |
| 不喜欢  | No. |
| 但我会吃掉  | But I eat them. |
| 谢尔顿  能听到吗  | Sheldon, can you hear me? |
| 我是你的双胞胎姐姐  米希  | It's your twin sister, Missy. |
| 家里一切都好  | Everything's all right here, |
| 但我觉得妈妈超想念你  | but I think Mom misses you real bad. |
| 好吧  我听不见你的声音  | All right, I can't hear you, |
| 我就挂断了  | so I'm gonna hang up now. |
| 晚安  | Good night. |
| 我告诉你  这是个坏主意  | I'm telling you, this is a terrible idea. |
| 是个糟透了的坏主意  | This is a terrible, terrible idea. |
| 他不会有事的  你等着瞧  | He's gonna be fine. You'll see. |
| 真不敢相信你对此没意见  | I can't believe you're okay with this. |
| 我当然有意见  | I'm not okay with this. |
| 我只是为了你  努力坚强  | I'm just trying to be strong for you! |
| 什么  你之前觉得他离开是个好主意  | What? You thought him leaving was a good idea. |
| 我那么说只是因为你觉得那是个坏主意  | Oh, I only said that because you thought it was a bad idea. |
| 你也知道跟别人唱反调是我的天性  | You know how it's always my nature to go the other way. |
| 说"上"  | Say "up." |
| 上  | Up. |
| 下  | Down. |
| 我出去一趟  | I'll see you in a bit. |
| 你要去哪儿  | Where are you off to? |
| 我要去达拉斯接谢尔顿回来  | I'm going to Dallas to get Sheldon. |
| -当真吗  -当真  | - Really? - Yeah, really. |
| 之前说的这对他是个好机会呢  | What about this being a great opportunity for him? |
| 你们到底想不想我去  | Y'all want me to go or not? |
| -想  快去  -想啊  赶紧的  | - Yes! Go! - Yes, and hurry up! |
| 快点  胖子  | Get a move on, Tubby. |
| 你要去哪儿  | Where you going? |
| 去接谢尔顿  | To get Sheldon. |
| 这事我有表决权吗  | Do I get a vote in this? |
| 没有  | No. |
| 靠  | Dang. |
| 那晚我无法轻易入睡  | Sleep didn't come easy that night, |
| 因为我知道  | knowing that, at any moment, |
| 我随时可能会被斩首  | I could be decapitated. |
| 还嫌那情况不够糟似的  | And as if that wasn't bad enough, |
| 我房间的床有防尘罩  | the bed in my room had a dust ruffle, |
| 在我幼小的头脑里  这只意味着一件事  | which, to my young mind, only meant one thing: |
| 这里有尘  | there was dust. |
| 但最终我还是迷迷糊糊睡着了  | But, eventually, I did drift off, |
| 心神不宁  | haunted by the memory, |
| 脑海里回放着我们三人围在钢琴旁  | the three of us gathered around the piano |
| 唱嬉皮民歌的画面  | singing hippie folk music. |
