| 工程学上的一项伟大成就  | A marvelous feat of engineering. |
| 一台能指导成千上万  | A computer capable of directing the lives |
| 人类生活的电脑系统  | of millions of human beings. |
| 但它始终是机器啊  史波克先生  | But only a machine, Mr. Spock. |
| 兰德鲁先生倾尽自己所有的知识打造它  | The original Landru programmed it with all his knowledge, |
| 但却无法将他的智慧  同情  | but he couldn't give it his wisdom, his compassion, |
| 理解与灵魂灌注给它  | his understanding, his soul. |
| 我更喜欢具体的  可理解  可证明的东西  | I prefer the concrete, the graspable, the provable. |
| 史波克先生  你一定能当一台很棒的电脑  | You'd make a splendid computer, Mr. Spock. |
| 舰长  谢谢您的夸奖  | That is very kind of you, Captain. |
| 这句的笑点  在史波克是半人半瓦肯人混血  | That's humorous, because Spock is half human and half Vulcan. |
| 但他对自己人性的那方面感到羞耻  | But he's ashamed of his human side. |
| 所以我对他很有认同感  | That's why I identify with him. |
| 祝好运  | Good luck. |
| 我更偏向寇克一点  | I gravitate a little more towards Kirk. |
| 为什么  | Why? |
| 因  为...  他所说的每  一  句  话  | Be-cause... everything he says... |
| 都说得好像很  重  要  | he makes sound so im-portant. |
| 这样没错啊  他可是舰长  | I should hope so-- he's the captain. |
| 谢尔顿  | Sheldon. |
| 帮我个忙  | Do me a favor. |
| 去给你哥补习明天的数学考试  | Go help your brother study for his math test tomorrow. |

| 乖啦  我都好好求你了  | Come on. I'm asking nice. |
| 他要是没及格  他就不能打橄榄球  | If he doesn't pass, he won't be able to play football. |
| 你知道他常欺负我吧  | You realize he's often mean to me. |
| 那又如何  你妈也常欺负我  我还是总帮她啊  | So? Your mother's mean to me. I still try to be helpful. |
| 她有朝你的脸放屁吗  | Does she break wind on your head? |
| 因为小乔治就对我这么做过  | Because that's what Georgie does to me. |
| 你能帮我劝劝他吗  | Can you help me out here? |
| 如果你带我去火车玩具店我就帮你  | I'll do it if you take me to the train store. |
| 没问题  | You got it. |
| 而且我想要什么你都得买给我  | And buy me whatever I want. |

| 只是在给我孙  子  | Just providing my grandson |

| 限20块以内  | under 20 bucks. |
| 成交  | Deal. |
| 为何  | Why? |
| 我疼他多过喜欢你  | I guess I like him better than you. |
| 小乔治  | Georgie? |
| 干嘛  | What? |
| 爸爸叫我来给你补习数学考试  | Dad told me to help you study for the math test. |
| 我才不用你帮忙  一边儿去  | I don't need your help. Get lost. |
| 小乔治  让他教你  | Georgie, let him help you! |
| 好啦  你进来  | Fine. Come in! |
| 天啊  | Oh, dear. |
| 你有何不满  | What's your problem? |
| 没有不满  我就...  | No problem. I'll just... |
| 一边教一边打扫吧  | tidy while we talk. |
| 随你便  | Help yourself. |
| 我们开始前  我想先了解一下  | Before we start, I'd like to get a sense |
| 你对代数有多少了解  | of how much algebra you know. |
| 行  | 'Kay. |
| 你懂怎么解与绘制线性不等式的图吗  | Do you understand solving and graphing linear inequalities? |
| 当然  | Sure. |
| 很好  你解释一遍给我听  | Great. Explain it to me. |
| 你先解出它们  | First you solve 'em... |
| 然后你画出它们  | and then you graph 'em. |
| 那你怎么做这些呢  | And how do you do that? |
| 你懂的  | Uh, you know, |
| 小心地做  | carefully. |
| 失陪一下  | Excuse me. |
| 这活儿20块接不了  | $20 isn't gonna do it. |

| 先合并所有X的同类项  | So you collect all the terms linear in X. |
| 你看  很简单吧  | See? Simple. |
| 对你简单而已吧  | Maybe for you. |
| 不是  对所有人来说都很简单  | No, it's simple for everybody. |
| 然后再合并所有Y的同类项  | Now you collect all the terms linear in Y. |
| 我不懂  | I don't get it. |
| 试试这个  先闭上眼睛  | Try this. Close your eyes. |
| 行  | 'Kay. |
| 你能看到  | Can you see |
| 由X与Y的系数所绘制出来的线吗  | the slope of the line given by the coefficients of X and Y? |
| 不能  | No. |
| 那你看到什么了  | What do you see? |
| 一片黑暗  | Darkness. |
| 再努力点  | Try harder. |
| 等等  | Wait. |
| 我看到澳大利亚名模穿着比基尼  | I see Elle Macpherson in a bikini. |
| 比基尼掉下来了  | Ooh, it just fell off. |
| 爸爸  | Dad! |
| 额度提到40块  继续教  | I'll make it $40! Keep going! |
| 或许问题是在于你不是个好老师  | Maybe the problem is you're not a good teacher. |
| 不太可能  而且无论如何  我都是你唯一希望  | Unlikely. Regardless, I am your only hope. |
| 那你闭上眼睛时会看到什么  | What do you see when you close your eyes? |
| 我看到第一象限是红色的  | I see quadrant one as red, |
| 第二象限柔软又毛茸茸  | quadrant two is soft and plush... |
| 第三象限闻起来有薰衣草味  | quadrant three smells like lavender, |
| 第四象限与斐波那契数列重叠在一起  | and quadrant four is overlaid with a Fibonacci spiral. |
| 真是太奇怪了  | That's really weird. |
| 才没有  真正奇怪的是解简单的代数时  | No. What's really weird is doing simple algebra |
| 脑海里却想着比基尼女郎  | and thinking about a girl in a bikini. |
| 我不同意  | I disagree. |
| 爸爸  | Dad! |
| 继续教  | Keep going. |
| 当除以负数时  | And when you divide by a negative number, |
| 你得把不等式的两端进行变号  | you have to reverse the direction of the inequality. |
| 我累了  我要去睡了  | I'm tired. I'm going to bed. |
| 但我们还没学完  你会挂科的  | But we're not done. You're going to fail. |
| 我听够多你说的话了  我能行  | I get enough of what you said. I'll be fine. |
| 就是在那一刻  我决定了  | It was at that moment I decided |
| 我并不适合教职  | I was not cut out for teaching. |
| 我用我在其他方面  | I consoled myself with the knowledge |
| 都无人能出其右来安慰了自己  | that I was wonderful at everything else. |
| 拿一份卷子就往后传  | Take one and pass it back. |
| 拿一份卷子就往后传  | Take one and pass it back. |
| 你们应该知道  这考试占学期总成绩25%  | As you all know, this test'll count for 25% of your final grade. |
| 记得写出所有计算过程  | Be sure to show all your work. |
| 如果被哪一题难住了  | If you get stuck on a question, |
| 先往下做  最后再回头想  | move on and come back to it at the end. |
| 最后这话我应该不用强调了  | And I shouldn't have to say this, |
| 但如果有人作弊  我绝对会抓到  | but if there's any cheating, I will see it. |
| 老师我脑袋后也有长眼睛  | I got eyes in the back of my head. |
| 我的眼睛比土豆上的洞眼还多  | I got more eyes than a potato. |
| 英格拉姆女士  | Ms. Ingram? |
| 怎么了  谢尔顿  | Yeah, Sheldon. |
| 我写完了  | I'm done. |
| 什么  | What? |
| 我很享受答卷的过程  | I enjoyed it very much. |
| 如果你还有别份卷子  我愿意要一份  | I'll take another if you have one. |
| 没了  我没有别份卷子  | No, I don't have another one. |
| 你先翻开课本往下看吧  | J-Just read ahead in the textbook. |
| 太好啦  | Oh, boy. |
| 看我哥垂死挣扎我也挺难受的  | Seeing my brother struggle was difficult for me. |
| 身为他的家教  他的失败  | As his tutor, I took his failure personally, |
| 感觉就像是我的失败  | almost as if I had failed. |
| 这挺怪的  因为我明知道他有多笨  | Which was odd, because I knew how dumb he was. |
| 小乔治  你今天数学考得如何  | Georgie, how'd you do on that math test today? |
| 还挺难的  | It was tough. |
| 我也说不准  | I don't know. |
| 抱歉我没能帮到你什么忙  | I'm sorry I wasn't more help. |
| 我也是  | Me, too. |
| 没事的  宝贝  你尽力了  | That's all right, baby, you tried. |
| 是啊  没关系的  宝贝  | Yeah. It's okay, baby. |
| 我不懂到底是哪里出了问题  | I don't understand what went wrong. |
| 你在怀小乔治的时候  | Is there any chance you drank alcohol |
| 是不是有喝过酒呢  | when you were pregnant with Georgie? |
| 没有  | No! |
| 不用这么高高在上  | Well, don't be so high-and-mighty. |
| 我在怀你的时候就有喝酒啊  | I drank when I was pregnant with you. |
| 你不也挺好的吗  | You turned out fine. |
| 这年头大家都在说"别喝酒  别抽烟"  | These days everybody's like, "Don't drink, don't smoke." |
| 德克萨斯都要变成加利福尼亚了  | I swear. Texas is turning into California. |
| 你知道你要是挂科了  我可帮不上你吧  | You realize there's nothing I can do if you fail. |
| 你得退橄榄球队  | You're off the team. |
| 我知道  | I know. |
| 我会求求耶稣基督  | Well, I'm gonna ask Jesus |
| 帮助你这场考试得到好成绩  | to help you get a good grade on that test. |
| 你应该在他去考试前祈求祂才对吧  | Shouldn't you have asked him before he took it? |
| 伟大的祂死后都能复生  | The man rose from the dead-- |
| 考完试之后再改应该只是小事一桩  | I think he can fix a test after the fact. |
| 你知道当我听到你说这种话时  | You know, I hear you say things like that, |
| 我都会扪心自问我是不是怀了你的时候  | and I wonder if maybe I did have a few too many whiskey sours |
| 喝了太多柠檬威士忌酒  | when you were in my belly. |
| 没到我的分数  不过还不错  | Not me, but not bad. |
| 我想说"A"级努力  | I would say "A" for effort, |
| 但"F"级分数  | but... that's an "F." |
| 怎么了  有多烂  | What? How bad is it? |
| 你得到了"B"  | You got a "B." |
| 不是吧  | Are you kidding? |
| 我真不敢相信  | I don't believe it. |
| 我也是  | Me, neither. |
| 我也是啊  | Me, neither. |
| 我觉得我得重新评估我的能力  | So, I guess I have to rethink my abilities. |
| 我很显然是个千古名师  | Clearly, I'm a wonderful teacher. |
| 小乔治不是因为你的教导而及格  | Georgie didn't pass because of you. |
| 你这话什么意思  | What do you mean? |
| 他作弊了  | He cheated. |
| 他把答案写在他鞋底了  | He had the answers written on the bottom of his shoe. |
| 他不会这样的  | He wouldn't do that. |
| 在学校考试骗人作弊  其实骗的只是自己  | When you cheat in school, you only cheat yourself. |
| 你从哪学到的话  | Where'd you get that? |
| 男厕外面的正能量海报上  | An inspirational poster outside the boys' room. |
| 谢尔顿  我绝对没看错  | I saw what I saw, Sheldon. |
| 如果这是真的  | Well, if this is true, |
| 他得去向老师坦白  | he needs to turn himself in. |
| 他不可能去  他会被踢出球队  | That'll never happen. He'll get kicked off the team. |
| 抱歉  恕我无法相信  | I'm sorry, I can't accept this. |
| 我相信此事一定还有别的解释  | There must be another explanation. |
| 如果你不相信我  你就去看他的鞋底  | If you don't believe me, look at his shoes. |
| 我会去的  | I will. |
| 这运动量挺大啊  | This is quite a workout. |
| 你个小人  | You dirty bird. |
| 你在我房间里干嘛  | What are you doing in here? |
| 你作弊了  | You cheated. |
| 我才没有  | No, I didn't. |
| 我手里就拿着证据  | I'm holding the evidence. |
| 让我看看  | Let me see that. |
| 我什么都没看到啊  | I don't see nothin'. |
| 你这是妨碍司法公正  | That's obstruction of justice, |
| 兼肮脏又没卫生  | as well as disgusting. |
| 别搞事  我考试及格  就能继续打球  | Oh, relax. By passing that test, I get to play football, |
| 你也能去火车玩具店买东西  | and you get to go to the train store. |
| 大家都有好处  | Everybody wins. |
| 那真相呢  | But what about the truth? |
| 怎么样  | What about it? |
| 真相[理]必叫我们得以自由  | It's supposed to set us free. |
| 这话你哪学的  | Who told you that? |
| 《圣经》啊  | The Bible. |
| 你什么时候信过《圣经》里写的话了  | Since when do you care about what's in the Bible? |
| 当那些话能让我驳倒别人的时候  | When it helps me win an argument. |
| 《圣经》也说"当孝敬父母"  | The Bible also says honor thy father and thy mother. |
| 如果你去跟他们说  你就会让他们伤心  | And if you open your mouth, you're gonna make them sad. |
| 他辩倒了我  | He had me. |
| 这二傻子莫名其妙地辩倒了我  | Somehow, the mullet-headed simpleton had me. |
| 这事没完  | This isn't over. |
| 是吗  你想怎么样  | Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do? |
| 好吧  好像完了  | All right, maybe it's over. |
| 姥姥  | Meemaw? |
| 我猜你已经看过公共卫生部部长关于  | I assume you've read the Surgeon General's report |
| 吸烟有害健康的报告了  | on the dangers of smoking? |
| 我等着他们把报告拍成电影呢  | I'm gonna wait till they turn it into a movie. |
| 那是你的新火车吗  | Is that your new train? |
| 是的  这是我帮小乔治通过数学考试的酬谢  | Yes. It's my reward for helping Georgie pass the math test. |
| 你看上去不是很开心啊  | You don't seem too happy about it. |
| 我觉得我不配拥有它  | I don't feel like I earned it. |
| 为什么  | Why not? |
| 你能帮我保守秘密吗  | Can you keep a secret? |
| 我这么大年纪了  能记住秘密就不错了  | Well, at my age, the question is can I remember one. |
| 说来听听  | Try me. |
| 小乔治考试作弊了  | Georgie cheated on the test. |
| 而且平安无事  | And nothing bad happened. |
| 他可以继续留在橄榄球队  | He gets to stay on the football team, |
| 爸妈以他为傲  | Mom and Dad are proud of him; |
| 我甚至因为帮他得到一辆小火车  | I even got a train for helping. |
| 所以你有负罪感  | So you're feeling guilty. |
| 正是这样  | Very much so. |
| 可真是个疑难杂症啊  | Well, that's a real conundrum. |
| 你是不是有在看我生日送给你的  | Have you been reading the Word of the Day calendar |
| 每日一词日历  | I gave you for your birthday? |
| 无可置疑  | Indubitably. |
| 你对此事作何感想  | So what do you think? |
| 我认为你不应该对此深受困扰  | I don't think you should let it bother you very much. |
| 我是说  这世上肯定有些人  | I mean, there's always gonna be people in this world |
| 会不守规则  | who are playing fast and loose with the rules. |
| 而你的哥哥就是这种人  | And your brother's one of them. |
| 《星际迷航》的寇克舰长也是  | That's how Captain Kirk is on Star Trek. |
| 没错  所以他是这部戏的主角  | Well, there you go, and he's, like, the main guy on that show. |
| 不  史波克先生才是主角  | No, Mr. Spock is the main guy. |
| 你说得对  | I stand corrected. |
| 不过通常拯救进取号的人都是寇克  | Although Kirk is usually the one who saves the Enterprise. |
| 因为他不会总是死守规矩吗  | Because he doesn't always follow the rules? |
| 他甚至在学员时期的一次测试中作弊  | He even cheated on a test when he was a cadet. |
| 小林丸号测试  | The Kobayashi Maru. |
| 小什么  | The what? |
| 小林丸  | Kobayashi Maru. |
| 寇克因此成为传奇  | Kirk is a legend because of it. |
| 小林丸  | Ko-Kobayashi Maru. |
| 听起来像是日式铁板烧餐厅里的食物名  | Sounds like something you eat at Benihana's. |
| 你有去过那种餐厅吗  | Have you ever been to one of those? |
| 店家会让你跟陌生人坐在一起  | They make you sit with strangers. |
| 真扯  | It's crazy. |
| 你觉得史波克会变成寇克这样的人吗  | Do you think a Spock could become a Kirk? |
| 以我的经验之谈  | Well, in my experience, |
| 大多数人活一辈子都是一个  | most people stay the miserable bastards they are |
| 可怜的混蛋  | their whole entire life. |
| 但...  | But... |
| 我也见过有人会改变  | I have seen some folks change. |
| 好吧  我要去玩这辆火车了  | All right. Well, I'm gonna go play with this train. |
| 去吧  | You do that. |
| 小乔治  | Georgie? |
| 走开  | Go away. |
| 我想请你帮个忙  | I need to ask a favor. |
| 什么忙  | What? |
| 秘密  我能进来吗  | It's private. Can I come in? |
| 进来吧  | Come on. |
| 你要干嘛  | What do you want? |
| 我发现你和寇克舰长有共同之处  | It occurs to me you have something in common with Captain Kirk. |
| 我俩的发型都很帅吗  | We both have cool hair? |
| 为了成功  | In order to succeed, |
| 你俩都不介意不守规则  | you both play fast and loose with the rules. |
| 对  我想是的  | Yeah, I suppose we do. |
| 你数学考试作弊的时候  你的策略是什么  | When you cheated on the math test, what was your strategy? |
| 我猜最重要的部分是  | Well, I guess the most important part |
| 考试之前不要踩到湿乎乎的东西  | was not stepping on anything wet before the test. |
| 还有千万不要拿"A"  | And not getting an "A." |
| 你为什么不想拿"A"  | Why wouldn't you want an "A"? |
| 因为那会引起怀疑  | 'Cause that would raise suspicions. |
| 谁会相信我能拿"A"  | Who would believe I got an "A"? |
| 再跟我说说  | Tell me more. |
| 好的  撒谎的时候  | Okay, when you're telling a lie, |
| 加入一些细节是关键  | it's important to throw in some details. |
| 比如我想去里奇家过夜  | Like, when I was wanted to spend the night at Ricky's house, |
| 妈妈问我他爸妈是否在家  | and Mom asked me if his mom and dad were gonna be home, |
| 我说他们不但在家  | I said, not only are they be gonna be home, |
| 他爸爸还会教我们  | his dad was gonna teach us |
| 怎么做烟熏火鸡腿  | how to cook turkey legs in the smoker. |
| 我喜欢火鸡腿  好吃吗  | I like turkey legs. Were they good? |
| 根本没有什么火鸡腿  你个白痴  | There weren't any turkey legs, you dope. |
| 他父母在外地呢  | His parents were in Branson. |
| 真厉害  我刚才完全相信你的话  | That's incredible. I totally believed you. |
| 细节啊细节  | Details. |
| 现在快出去  我得看完这本书  | Now get out of here, I got to finish reading this. |
| 谢谢  小乔治  你真帮了我大忙  | Thank you, Georgie, that was very helpful. |
| 你听见了吗  | Did you hear that? |
| 什么  | What? |
| 听起来小乔治和谢尔顿处得挺好  | Sounds like Georgie and Sheldon are getting along. |
| 是吗  | Really? |
| 不可能啊  | That can't be right. |
| 我刚听见的  | I just heard it. |
| 或许他们俩还有希望能处得来  | Maybe there's hope for those two after all. |
| 或者这是末日的征兆  | Or it's a sign of the apocalypse. |
| 亲爱的  别打扰我看电视  | Honey, I'm-I'm watching this. |
| 今天的体育课  | So you'll have to find someone else |
| 你得找别人帮你按脚踝了  | to hold your ankles in P.E. Today. |
| 抱歉  你说什么  | I'm sorry, what? |
| 我受了重伤  没办法上课了  | I've suffered a terrible injury and won't be able to attend. |
| 发生什么事了  | What happened? |
| 你自己看  | See for yourself. |
| "威尔金斯教练  请批准我的儿子谢尔顿  | "Dear Coach Wilkins, please excuse my son, Sheldon, |
| 不上体育课  | From P.E. |
| 他得了睾丸疝气  | He has experienced a testicular hernia, |
| 接下来的六到八周都需要好好休息  | And needs to rest for the next six to eight weeks. |
| 真诚的玛丽·库珀"  | Sincerely, Mary Cooper." |
| 睾丸疝气吗  | Testicular hernia? |
| 这就叫细节  | That's called details. |
| 真是可怜  | Ooh, that's rough. |
| 怎么弄的  | Hmm. How'd it happen? |
| 不好说  | It's hard to say, |
| 但风险因素包括:  提重物  慢性咳嗽  | but some risk factors include: heavy lifting, a chronic cough |
| 排便时的重复性劳损  | and repetitive straining during bowel movements. |
| 我也有个这经历  | I've been there. |
| 好吧  | Hmm. All right. |
| 那就...六到八周后见吧  | Guess I'll see you in... six to eight weeks. |
| 我不知道其他超级大反派  | I don't know if other supervillains |
| 是否是从翘体育课开始他们的职业生涯  | started their careers by getting out of P.E., |
| 但我是  | but that's where I began. |
| 有我捏造的疝气来壮胆  | Emboldened by my faux hernia, |
| 我开始把图书馆的书拿出来  | I started taking books out of the library... |
| 而不去盖借阅的章  | without getting the cards stamped. |
| 那些书你还没登记呢  | You didn't check out those books. |
| 我知道  | I know. |
| 在你严厉地批判我前  | Before you judge me too harshly, |
| 我想说  我每次都按时还回去  | I always brought them back on time. |
| 我是破坏规矩的人  不是疯子  | I was a rule-breaker, not a lunatic. |
| 但或许我最满意的违规  | But perhaps my most satisfying transgression |
| 是欺骗我姐姐  | was duping my sister |
| 放弃电视的控制权  | into relinquishing control of the TV. |
| 你好  | Hello. |
| 那玩意是干啥的  | What's that for? |
| 这个吗  我刚在姥姥后院挖钱呢  | Oh, this? I was just digging for money in Meemaw's backyard. |
| 那里有钱吗  | There's money there? |
| 有啊  我已经发现七毛五了  | Oh, yes. I already found 75 cents. |
| 你觉得是谁的钱  | Who do you think left it? |
| 如果让我猜  | If I were to guess, |
| 我觉得是口袋破洞的海盗  | I'd say pirates with holes in their pockets. |
| 铲子能借我用用吗  | Can I use your shovel? |
| 请便  | Be my guest. |
| 宝贝  我要发大财了  | Oh, baby, I'm gonna be rich. |
| 今天我们来学习牛顿爵士  | Today, we're going to learn about Sir Isaac Newton. |
| 你好  老朋友  | Hello, old friend. |
| 世界上最伟大的科学家之一  | ...one of the world's greatest scientists... |
| 明天见  韦恩  | See you tomorrow, Wayne. |
| 祝你愉快  乔治  | You have a good one, George. |
| 你儿子怎么样了  | Hey, how's your son doing? |
| 小乔治吗  | Georgie? |
| 不  聪明那个  | No, the smart one. |
| 他挺好的  怎么了  | He's fine. Why? |
| 他的疝气呢  | What about the hernia? |
| 什么疝气  | What hernia? |
| 你妻子说他得了啊  | The one your wife said he had. |
| 我在军队时也得过  | Happened to me while I was in the Army. |
| 是在乔治亚州的一间酒吧  试图抱起个胖妹  | I was in a bar in Georgia, tried to lift up this big gal. |
| 我绝对听到我下面有啥爆炸声  | Swear I could hear something pop down there. |
| 这张条是谢尔顿给你的吗  | Sheldon gave you this note? |
| 是的  | Yeah. |
| 这不是我写的  | I didn't write this. |
| 你确定吗  | You sure? |
| 看起来像你的笔迹  | Looks like your handwriting. |
| 字体看起来有点飘  | It's got that little swoopy thing going on. |
| 不是我写的  | I didn't write it. |
| 如果我儿子得疝气  我肯定知道  | And I think I'd know if my son had a hernia. |
| 那就是谢尔顿为了不上体育课  伪造了请假条  | So what, Sheldon forged a letter to get out of P.E.? |
| 貌似是的  | Looks like it. |
| 真行啊  | How about that. |
| 别为他感到骄傲  | Don't be proud of him. |
| 我情不自禁  | Can't help it. |
| 第一次他这么像我的亲儿子  | First time he ever seemed like my kid. |
| 你知道他为什么突然转了性吗  | Do you have any idea what's gotten into him? |
